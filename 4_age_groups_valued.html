        <h1>Question #4: Assess the extent to which different age groups in your society are valued equally</h1>
        <div class="word-count">Model Answer: 768 words | Target Band: 5</div>

        <h2>SECTION 1: Understanding the Question</h2>
        <h3>Question Type & Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type (VIPERCJ):</strong> VALUE question - asking about worth, importance, significance accorded to different age groups</li>
            <li><strong>Core Issue:</strong> Do all age groups receive equal societal valuation? Or does Singapore systematically privilege some ages (working-age adults, youth) while undervaluing others (elderly, young children)?</li>
            <li><strong>Singapore Context - CRITICAL:</strong> Aging population (by 2030: 1 in 4 over 65), meritocratic culture (rewards productive workers), education-focused (investments in youth). These create systematic biases in how age groups are valued.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>UNDERSTANDING "VALUED":</strong>
            <p>"Valued" encompasses: resource allocation (budget, services), social recognition (respect, status), inclusion in decision-making, and expectations placed on groups. Singapore doesn't value all age groups equally if resources, respect, and opportunities are distributed unequally.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 3: Model Answer</h2>
        <div class="essay-text">
            <p>Singapore's society <span class="highlight-relevance">does not value different age groups equally</span>, instead demonstrating systematic institutional and cultural biases that privilege working-age adults and youth while systematically undervaluing the elderly and very young. <span class="highlight-sophistication">This disparity reflects tensions between Singapore's meritocratic ideology, which rewards productive contribution, and its demographic reality of rapid aging</span>, creating a society where life value correlates dangerously with economic productivity rather than human dignity across the lifespan.</p>

            <p>Working-age adults (25-64) are clearly <span class="highlight-relevance">most valued in Singapore's meritocratic system</span>, as they represent productive economic contributors and tax-payers sustaining the state. Government policies overwhelmingly prioritize this group: tax incentives for employment, workplace development programs, housing grants tied to employment status, and skills training investments target working-age citizens. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This prioritization is rational from economic perspective - working-age adults generate productivity and tax revenue - but it reveals that Singapore's valuation is fundamentally productivity-based rather than equity-based.</span> Youth (15-24) similarly receive substantial investment through education spending, skills development, and youth programs, reflecting Singapore's belief in investing in future potential. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This forward-looking investment makes demographic sense but again privileges those seen as economic assets while disfavoring those without future earning potential.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, the most valued age groups are those contributing to or expected to contribute to Singapore's economic productivity.</span></p>

            <p>Conversely, <span class="highlight-relevance">elderly citizens face systematic undervaluation</span> despite rhetoric celebrating filial piety and respect for elders. Singapore's policy framework reveals this disparity starkly: public healthcare spending per capita for elderly (60+) is lower than for working-age despite higher medical needs; retirement adequacy remains precarious with many elderly living below poverty line; Active Ageing rhetoric masks inadequate long-term care infrastructure and chronic understaffing in nursing homes. <span class="highlight-evaluation">The 2022 ElderCare Taskforce Report revealed 1 in 3 seniors living in poverty despite government support - indicating that rhetoric about elderly valuation doesn't translate into adequate resource allocation.</span> Moreover, elderly have minimal voice in policy decisions affecting them, excluded from most decision-making bodies and treated as policy subjects rather than stakeholders. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This silencing reveals that elderly aren't truly valued as equal participants in society but as burdens to be managed.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, the elderly demonstrate clear undervaluation despite cultural narratives celebrating respect for age.</span></p>

            <p><span class="highlight-sophistication">Most troubling is the systematic undervaluation of very young children</span> (0-5), where Singapore invests minimally in early childhood despite research showing early years as most developmentally critical. Childcare remains prohibitively expensive, forcing many families into precarious arrangements; preschool coverage is insufficient; support for young mothers remains inadequate. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This underinvestment in early childhood - despite Singapore's education-focused culture - reveals that very young are not recognized as valuable until they become school-age and "productive."</span> <span class="highlight-link">Both elderly and very young face undervaluation, though for different reasons: elderly appear no longer productive, very young not yet productive.</span></p>

            <p><span class="highlight-sophistication">Ultimately</span>, Singapore's age group valuation reflects a <span class="highlight-relevance">productivity hierarchy rather than equal valuation</span>: working-age most valued, youth secondarily valued for future potential, elderly and young children undervalued due to perceived non-productivity. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This arrangement contradicts Singapore's stated values of meritocracy (which should reward contribution, not future earning potential) and filial piety (which would value elderly wisdom, not penalize age).</span> <span class="highlight-link">Singapore's demographic crisis - with elderly population exploding while birth rates plummet - will force recalibration of these valuations unless policies fundamentally shift to recognize value across all life stages, not just productive years.</span></p>

        <h2>SECTION 4: Key Learning Points</h2>
        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #1 - Breaking Down "Valued" into Measurable Dimensions:</strong>
            <p>"Valued" is abstract. This essay made it concrete by examining:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resource allocation (budget, services, infrastructure)</li>
                <li>Policy priority (which groups do policies target?)</li>
                <li>Status/respect (how are they spoken about?)</li>
                <li>Decision-making voice (are they included in decisions?)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This approach prevents vague essay about "value" and grounds it in measurable disparity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #2 - Using Singapore's Characteristics to Explain the Pattern:</strong>
            <p>The essay explains WHY Singapore values age groups unequally:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meritocratic ideology (rewards productivity)</li>
                <li>Pragmatic culture (values what works/generates output)</li>
                <li>Economic imperatives (needs productive workforce)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This shows understanding of Singapore's unique values creating specific biases, not just describing what happens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #3 - Using Data as Evidence (ElderCare Report):</strong>
            <p>"1 in 3 seniors living in poverty" - specific statistic shows unequal valuation concretely. Pairs rhetoric (respect elders) with reality (poverty), revealing gap between stated and actual values.</p>
            <p>Strategy: When claiming inequality exists, back with specific data showing the disparity.</p>
