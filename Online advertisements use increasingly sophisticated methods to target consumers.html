    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Increasingly sophisticated online advertisements do more harm than good, as the use of <strong>advanced psychological tricks</strong> to <strong>delude and deceive</strong> consumers has prompted them to part with their precious cash for products they do not need, hurting them <strong>financially</strong> much worse than it helps already-loaded firms.</li>
        <li>b. Increasingly sophisticated online advertisements do more harm than good, as the power that <strong>modern technology</strong> grants firms to <strong>personalise their marketing and messaging</strong> to each consumer enables them to make <strong>money</strong> at the expense of our priceless <strong>privacy</strong>.</li>
        <li>c. Increasingly sophisticated online advertisements do more good than harm, as consumers these days are <strong>evolving in media literacy</strong> at the same time as firms are <strong>enlarging their repertoire of tricks</strong>, such that we can use advertisements to <strong>make informed purchasing decisions</strong> more often than not.</li>
        <li>d. Increasingly sophisticated online advertisements do more good than harm, as the use of <strong>content creators and celebrities</strong> to <strong>distance firms from the advertising act</strong> and <strong>disarm buyers</strong> has had the side-effect of rendering <strong>new forms of work</strong> profitable and possible, thus there are more stakeholders benefiting than suffering from such a trend.</li>
    </ul>
