        <p>Question 114 - Science & Technology (Responsibility)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>Question:</strong> 'Social media platforms should be held legally responsible for the content shared on them.' How far do you agree?
    </div>

    <div class="essay">
        <p>In an era where social media platforms wield unprecedented influence over global discourse, the question of legal responsibility for user-generated content has become one of the most contentious issues of our time. While holding platforms legally accountable for content may seem like a logical response to the proliferation of harmful material online, the reality is far more nuanced. I argue that complete legal responsibility would be both impractical and dangerous, though platforms should bear some accountability through graduated responsibility frameworks that balance free expression with harm prevention.</p>

        <p>The case for platform responsibility rests on their immense power and influence. Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok collectively reach billions of users, shaping public opinion and political discourse on a scale that rivals traditional media. Unlike passive hosting services, these platforms actively curate content through sophisticated algorithms that determine what users see, effectively functioning as publishers rather than mere conduits. When these algorithms amplify misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines or promote extremist content that radicalizes users, platforms profit from engagement while society bears the costs. The 2021 Facebook whistleblower revelations demonstrated that platforms knowingly prioritize engagement over user safety, suggesting that only legal consequences will compel meaningful change.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, platforms possess the technological capabilities and resources to moderate content effectively. Advanced AI systems can already detect hate speech, violence, and misinformation with increasing accuracy. Companies that generate billions in revenue can reasonably be expected to invest in comprehensive content moderation systems. The current self-regulation model has proven inadequate, with platforms consistently failing to prevent the spread of demonstrably harmful content, from terrorist recruitment videos to coordinated harassment campaigns that drive victims to suicide.</p>

        <p>However, imposing blanket legal responsibility would create severe practical and philosophical problems. The sheer volume of content uploaded to social media platforms every minute—over 500 hours of video on YouTube alone—makes comprehensive pre-publication review impossible. Even with AI assistance, content moderation requires complex contextual judgments that often confound human reviewers. Automated systems frequently struggle with sarcasm, cultural nuances, and legitimate political discourse that may superficially resemble hate speech.</p>

        <p>More fundamentally, legal responsibility for all content would threaten free expression and democratic discourse. Faced with potential liability, platforms would inevitably err on the side of over-censorship, removing legitimate content to avoid legal consequences. This could silence marginalized voices, suppress political dissent, and limit public debate on controversial but important topics. The experience of Germany's NetzDG law, which requires platforms to remove "obviously illegal" content within 24 hours, illustrates this risk—studies show the law has led to over-removal of legitimate content due to platforms' fear of penalties.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the global nature of social media complicates legal responsibility frameworks. Content legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another, forcing platforms to navigate conflicting legal requirements. Full legal responsibility could fragment the internet, with platforms either withdrawing from certain markets or creating country-specific versions that undermine the global connectivity that makes social media valuable.</p>

        <p>A more balanced approach would establish graduated responsibility based on platform behavior rather than content outcomes. Platforms should face legal consequences for algorithmic amplification of harmful content, failure to respond promptly to valid takedown requests, and deliberate design choices that prioritize engagement over safety. This would incentivize responsible platform design while preserving space for legitimate expression. Transparency requirements could mandate disclosure of algorithmic processes and content moderation decisions, enabling public scrutiny without direct legal liability for individual posts.</p>

        <p>Moreover, focusing solely on platform responsibility risks overlooking other crucial stakeholders. Governments must invest in digital literacy education, helping citizens critically evaluate online information. Users bear responsibility for their own posts and shares. Traditional media outlets should fact-check viral claims rather than amplifying them uncritically. Addressing social media's challenges requires a ecosystem-wide approach rather than placing all responsibility on platforms.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, while social media platforms must be held more accountable for their role in spreading harmful content, blanket legal responsibility would create more problems than it solves. Instead, we need nuanced regulatory frameworks that target platform behaviors while preserving free expression, combined with broader societal efforts to build resilience against online manipulation. The goal should not be to eliminate all harmful content—an impossible task—but to create incentive structures that promote responsible platform design and empower users to navigate the digital landscape safely and critically.</p>
