    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. It is always right to challenge injustice as humans owe it to one another, as <strong>allies from the same species and adherents of the same universal moral code</strong>, to <strong>right any wrongs</strong> we see and re-establish a world where <strong>everyone gets what they deserve</strong>. [Job Scope]</li>
        <li>b. It is always right to challenge injustice as, even when the heroic move does not help things, one is still <strong>able</strong> to <strong>send a crucial message</strong> and <strong>set clear boundaries</strong>, rendering it the right move regardless of outcome. [Ability]</li>
        <li>c. It is not always right to challenge injustice as <strong>stepping in to save others</strong> when one is <strong>unable</strong> to even <strong>secure one's own safety</strong> is a futile gesture that sometimes brings more <strong>harm</strong> than good. [Ability]</li>
        <li>d. It is not always right to challenge injustice as <strong>meddling</strong> in matters one <strong>barely understands</strong> out of a naive desire to do good may make things worse, not better. [Ability]</li>
    </ul>
