        <div class="question">Question 89: 'For the majority of people, the Arts are irrelevant to their daily lives.' How true is this of your society?</div>

    <div class="essay">
        <p>The assertion that the arts are irrelevant to daily life for most Singaporeans reflects a superficial understanding of how deeply artistic expression permeates our society. While Singapore's pragmatic culture might suggest that utilitarian concerns overshadow aesthetic pursuits, a closer examination reveals that the arts are inextricably woven into the fabric of Singaporean daily experience, serving functions far beyond mere decoration or entertainment.</p>

        <p>Most immediately visible is the omnipresence of design in Singapore's urban landscape, where artistic sensibilities shape daily navigation and interaction. The architectural aesthetics of Housing Development Board flats, with their increasingly sophisticated facades and integrated community spaces, demonstrate how artistic planning influences where and how millions of Singaporeans live. The carefully curated public art installations along the Singapore River, the sculptural elements of Marina Bay Sands, and the botanical artistry of Gardens by the Bay are not distant museum pieces but integral components of daily commutes, recreational activities, and social gatherings. These artistic elements unconsciously influence mood, social interaction, and civic pride, making them functionally relevant rather than merely decorative.</p>

        <p>Singapore's multicultural identity finds its most vivid expression through artistic traditions that remain vibrantly active in contemporary life. The intricate kolam patterns that appear during Deepavali, the calligraphic traditions practiced in void deck celebrations during Chinese New Year, and the batik motifs that emerge during Hari Raya are not museum artifacts but living practices that structure community relationships and cultural transmission. These artistic traditions serve practical social functions: they create spaces for intergenerational dialogue, establish cultural continuity, and provide frameworks for community bonding that transcend mere nostalgia.</p>

        <p>The digital age has paradoxically increased rather than diminished artistic relevance in Singaporean daily life. Social media platforms have democratized artistic creation, with ordinary Singaporeans regularly engaging in visual storytelling through Instagram aesthetics, TikTok choreography, and YouTube content creation. The rise of local content creators who blend artistic expression with commercial success—from food photography that elevates hawker culture to fashion influencers who reinterpret traditional motifs—demonstrates how artistic skills have become economically valuable rather than economically irrelevant. The creative economy, which the government has actively promoted through initiatives like the Creative Industry Development Strategy, recognizes that artistic capabilities are increasingly essential for economic competitiveness.</p>

        <p>However, the perception of artistic irrelevance persists in certain segments of Singaporean society, particularly where immediate economic pressures dominate daily concerns. For families struggling with cost-of-living increases or students focused intensely on academic achievement, artistic pursuits may indeed seem like luxuries rather than necessities. The tendency to view arts education as supplementary rather than fundamental reflects deeper cultural assumptions about value and utility that can create genuine disconnection between artistic expression and daily priorities.</p>

        <p>Yet even this apparent disconnection reveals the arts' relevance through its absence. The mental health challenges that have become increasingly prominent in Singapore, particularly among young people, are often linked to the pressure of purely utilitarian lifestyles that leave little space for creative expression or aesthetic experience. The growing recognition of arts therapy, creative wellness programs, and the psychological benefits of cultural engagement suggests that artistic irrelevance may itself be a social problem rather than a natural state.</p>

        <p>Singapore's evolution as a global city has also positioned artistic sophistication as a marker of social and economic development. The establishment of world-class cultural institutions like the National Gallery and the Esplanade reflects governmental recognition that artistic vitality is essential for maintaining Singapore's international competitiveness and quality of life. These investments acknowledge that artistic relevance extends beyond individual preference to encompass national identity and economic strategy.</p>

        <p>The question ultimately reveals a false dichotomy between practical relevance and artistic value. In Singapore's context, the arts serve multiple simultaneous functions: they preserve cultural heritage, facilitate social cohesion, support economic development, enhance psychological well-being, and contribute to national identity. Rather than being irrelevant to daily life, the arts are so thoroughly integrated into Singaporean society that their relevance often becomes invisible precisely because it is so fundamental. The challenge lies not in proving artistic relevance but in maintaining conscious appreciation for the ways artistic expression continuously shapes and enriches the supposedly mundane aspects of daily existence in contemporary Singapore.</p>
