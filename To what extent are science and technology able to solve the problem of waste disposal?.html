                <ul>
                    <li>The product of science refers to the <strong>body of knowledge</strong> about the workings of the <strong>empirical, natural, physical world</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The process of science refers to a <strong>method of inquiry</strong> involving <strong>experimentation, observation, and testing of hypotheses</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Technology refers to the <strong>practical application</strong> of science to serve <strong>human needs and solve human problems</strong>.</li>

                <strong>What science and technology offer:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Science is a reliable way to probe the root cause of a problem and prescribe a solution.</li>

                    <li>Waste is caused and created by <strong>all humans</strong>, whether at an <strong>individual</strong> level (e.g. discarded goods, leftover foods) or at a <strong>collective</strong> level (e.g. industrial byproducts).</li>
                    <li>Waste disposal is a problem because there is <strong>so much of it</strong>, it is <strong>harmful</strong> to both the <strong>environment and human health</strong>, and it will exist <strong>as long as human activities</strong> exist.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Something that either reduces the amount of waste, or reduces the harmfulness of waste.</li>
                    <li>Something that either addresses individual sources of waste or collective sources of waste.</li>
                    <li>Something that is universally applicable.</li>

    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Science and technology are an effective solution to the problem of waste disposal as they can <strong>pinpoint the root source of excess waste and provide practical inventions</strong> to <strong>reduce how much of it</strong> we are clogging the earth's air, land, and waters with. [Profundity]</li>
        <li>b. Science and technology are an effective solution to the problem of waste disposal as they can <strong>turn the issue on its head</strong> by <strong>transforming waste from harmful pollutant to helpful resource</strong>, addressing it <strong>once and for all</strong>. [Durability]</li>
        <li>c. Science and technology are not an effective solution to the problem of waste disposal as they can answer only it at a <strong>technical</strong> level, but its true roots lie in <strong>human</strong> behaviour, be it individual purchases or industrial practices. [Profundity]</li>
        <li>d. Science and technology are not an effective solution to the problem of waste disposal as they are <strong>costly</strong> to undertake, making them a poor fit for an issue that is <strong>global</strong> in scope--especially since the poorest nations with the greatest need to upgrade their infrastructure are also the ones least able to afford such an investment. [Reliability]</li>
    </ul>
