                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conservative</strong> (especially in the past)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pragmatic</strong></li>

                <strong>What Singapore does:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our conservatism causes us to be prejudicial to criminals and crime, preferring to be safe, not sorry, by erring on the side of harshness.</li>
                    <li>Our pragmatism causes us to sacrifice individual liberty for collective security, letting the ends justify the means.</li>
                    <li>Our progressivism causes us to use education both pre-emptively and post-hoc, trusting individuals to make the right decisions.</li>
                    <li>Our technological prowess causes our surveillance systems to have a comprehensive and conspicuous presence across the island.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The justice system has the <strong>idealistic</strong> goal of <strong>promoting justice</strong> and the <strong>practical</strong> goal of <strong>protecting social order</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Deterrence uses the <strong>threat of unpleasant penalties</strong> to <strong>disincentivise past offenders</strong> from re-offending, and <strong>discourage potential offenders</strong> from offending.</li>
                    <li>Punishment additionally can be about <strong>restitution</strong> or <strong>retribution</strong>, which involve <strong>doing good</strong> to make up for the bad one has done, or <strong>suffering</strong> in proportion to the suffering one has caused.</li>
                </ul>
                 <strong>What we are looking for in a method to deter crime and punish criminals:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Something that both protects social order and promotes justice.</li>
                    <li>Something that is both proactive and reactive.</li>
                    <li>Something that fulfils the justice system's responsibilities to society at large, the victim, and possibly the criminal.</li>
                    <li>Something that fulfils the government's broader responsibilities too, like obeying human rights and optimising resources.</li>

    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. The measures we take to deter crime and punish criminals are effective as our <strong>pragmatic</strong> use of <strong>draconian penalties</strong> (like hanging) <strong>defend society from danger and disorder</strong> and <strong>deliver justice to victims</strong>, fulfilling their <strong>fundamental duties</strong> to the justice system's <strong>main stakeholders</strong>. [Profundity]</li>
        <li>b. The measures we take to deter crime and punish criminals are effective as our <strong>high-tech systems</strong> enforce order in both offline and online spaces, both <strong>encouraging us to behave ourselves at all times</strong> and <strong>ensuring that anyone who misbehaves gets duly disciplined</strong>. [Reliability]</li>
        <li>c. The measures we take to deter crime and punish criminals are not effective as they adopt the <strong>conservative</strong> assumption that crime inherently reflects immorality and criminals are irredeemably immoral, and their harshness fails to not only be <strong>fair to people deserving a second chance</strong> but also <strong>frighten people who have given up on the system</strong>. [Profundity]</li>
        <li>d. The measures we take to deter crime and punish criminals are not effective as the use of <strong>education</strong>, a more <strong>progressive</strong> approach, takes <strong>too long</strong> to bear fruit, whether to <strong>raise awareness among would-be offenders</strong> or <strong>rehabilitate ex-offenders over the course of their prison or probation term</strong>. [Timeliness]</li>
    </ul>
