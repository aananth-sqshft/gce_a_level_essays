            <strong>Thesis:</strong> While modern technology and democratic movements have significantly enhanced popular power, the statement oversimplifies a complex reality where power is increasingly distributed but politicians and institutional elites retain substantial control over key decision-making processes.
        </div>

        <p>In an era defined by social media revolutions, grassroots movements, and digital democratization, the traditional paradigm of political power appears to be shifting. The Arab Spring, #MeToo movement, and climate activism led by figures like Greta Thunberg suggest that ordinary citizens possess unprecedented ability to influence global discourse and drive political change. However, while people today undeniably wield more power than in previous generations, the assertion that they hold more power than politicians represents an oversimplification of contemporary power dynamics.</p>

        <p>The most compelling evidence for popular empowerment lies in the transformative potential of digital platforms and social movements. Social media has democratized information dissemination, allowing grassroots campaigns to mobilize millions without traditional gatekeepers. The 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, sparked by citizen journalism documenting police brutality, forced legislative changes across multiple countries and corporations to reassess their policies. Similarly, the #MeToo movement toppled powerful figures from Harvey Weinstein to various political leaders, demonstrating how collective citizen action can overcome institutional protection of the elite. Environmental activism showcases perhaps the clearest example of popular power, with youth-led movements compelling governments worldwide to declare climate emergencies and commit to carbon neutrality targets.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, the economic dimension of popular power has expanded dramatically through consumer activism and the gig economy. Cancel culture, whatever its merits, represents a form of distributed economic enforcement where public opinion can destroy careers and corporate value overnight. The 2021 GameStop stock surge, orchestrated by retail investors on Reddit, demonstrated how coordinated popular action could challenge Wall Street institutions. Consumers increasingly vote with their wallets, forcing corporations to adopt sustainable practices and social responsibility measures that politicians struggle to legislate.</p>

        <p>However, this apparent democratization of power masks several critical limitations that ensure politicians and institutional elites retain decisive control. First, the agenda-setting power remains concentrated among political and media elites. While citizens can mobilize around issues, politicians and their institutional apparatus largely determine which concerns receive legislative attention and resources. The widespread public support for healthcare reform in many countries often fails to translate into policy change when it conflicts with political or corporate interests.</p>

        <p>Second, the structural mechanisms of governance ensure that popular power must ultimately channel through political institutions to achieve lasting change. Electoral systems, legislative procedures, and bureaucratic implementation remain under political control. The European Union's handling of Brexit, despite clear popular sentiment, illustrates how political institutions can frustrate popular will through procedural complexity and institutional resistance. Similarly, climate activism has raised awareness but the substantive policy responses depend entirely on political willingness to implement economically costly measures.</p>

        <p>Perhaps most significantly, the digital platforms that seemingly empower citizens are themselves controlled by a small number of technology corporations whose algorithms and policies shape public discourse. The power to amplify or suppress information, demonstrated by Twitter's suspension of political figures and Facebook's content moderation policies, reveals that apparent popular power operates within parameters set by corporate and political elites. The phenomenon of "manufactured consent" has evolved into sophisticated manipulation of public opinion through targeted advertising and algorithmic curation.</p>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic starkly illustrated the limits of popular power when confronted with government authority. Despite significant public resistance to lockdown measures in various countries, governments successfully implemented unprecedented restrictions on movement and assembly. The speed and comprehensiveness of these measures revealed that when political will exists, institutional power can override popular opposition through legal, economic, and social pressure mechanisms.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the global nature of contemporary challenges often requires coordination beyond the reach of local popular movements. International trade negotiations, monetary policy, and military interventions occur in spaces where popular input is minimal and political expertise is paramount. The complexity of modern governance requires specialized knowledge and international relationships that remain concentrated among political and bureaucratic elites.</p>

        <p>The reality of contemporary power distribution is best understood as increasingly complex and networked rather than simply transferred from politicians to people. Citizens possess more tools for influence and resistance than ever before, but this operates within systems ultimately controlled by political institutions and economic elites. Popular power is most effective when it aligns with existing political incentives or when it can credibly threaten electoral consequences.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, while the digital age has undeniably enhanced popular agency and created new channels for citizen influence, the fundamental structures of political and economic power remain concentrated among institutional elites. The people today possess more power than in previous eras, but this exists in dynamic tension with, rather than dominance over, political power. The most accurate characterization would be that power has become more distributed and contested, with politicians forced to be more responsive to popular pressure while retaining ultimate decision-making authority. True democratization of power would require structural reforms to political and economic institutions that those currently in power have little incentive to implement.</p>
