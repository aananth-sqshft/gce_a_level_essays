        <h1>Model Answer Analysis: Social Justice and Legitimate Debate</h1>
        <div class="word-count">Question Type: Justification (J) - Contemporary Issue | Topic: Society & Culture</div>

        <h2>SECTION 1: INITIAL THINKING PROCESS</h2>

        <h3>First Impressions</h3>
        <p>
            This is a <span class="highlight-relevance">Justification question with an extreme word: "gone too far."</span> It's asking whether pursuit of social justice has crossed a line into silencing legitimate debate.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question type:</strong> J (Justification) — Is it right/justified? The extreme word "too far" signals we might need to explore when social justice is justified vs. when it goes overboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The two sides:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SIDE A (It HAS gone too far):</strong> Cancel culture, self-censorship, some debates become off-limits, minority perspectives silenced, nuance lost</li>
                <li><strong>SIDE B (It HASN'T gone too far / justified):</strong> Marginalized voices need platforms, calling out harm is necessary, accountability is not silencing</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>KEY INSIGHT:</strong> The word "legitimate debate" is crucial. The argument isn't "Should we discuss social justice?" but "Are some legitimate debates being silenced?" This nuance guides argument construction.
        </div>

        <h3>Understanding Keywords</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>"Pursuit of social justice":</strong> Activism, awareness campaigns, accountability movements, calls for equity, challenging discrimination
            <br><br>
            <strong>"Gone too far":</strong> Crossed a line, exceeded justifiable limits, created unintended harms
            <br><br>
            <strong>"Silencing legitimate debate":</strong> Making certain conversations impossible, fear of speaking prevents exploration of complex issues
        </p>

            <li><strong>Para 2:</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">"However, attributing debate silence to social justice alone ignores how marginalized groups have historically been excluded from conversations, and current backlash against 'cancel culture' may exaggerate its actual impact on legitimate discourse."</span></li>
            <li><strong>Para 3:</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">"A more nuanced assessment recognizes that social justice movements have been necessary for including previously silenced voices, but some institutional implementations have become overly rigid, creating a conditional answer: social justice hasn't gone too far in principle, but sometimes in practice."</span></li>

        <h2>SECTION 3: BAND 5 MODEL ANSWER (710 words)</h2>

        <div class="essay-text">
            <p>
                <span class="highlight-relevance">The pursuit of social justice has created genuine tension with open debate, with cancel culture and institutional overcaution producing real instances of self-censorship.</span> Yet the statement that this has "gone too far" requires nuance: while some implementations have become excessive, social justice movements have also been necessary for enabling historically silenced voices to participate in debate. The fairest assessment is that social justice is justified in its aims but has occasionally been unjustified in its tactics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Clear evidence supports the claim that social justice activism has, in certain contexts, silenced legitimate debate. <span class="highlight-relevance">Cancel culture—the coordinated withdrawal of support from individuals due to controversial statements—has created measurable chilling effects on discourse.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">When academics, journalists, or public figures face professional consequences for expressing nuanced views on contested issues (such as sex-based rights versus transgender inclusion, or debate over historical figures' legacies), people learn to self-censor rather than risk social or professional destruction. This is not debate refusal based on the strength of arguments, but debate avoidance based on consequences. It represents a form of silencing.</span> Institutional responses exemplify this: universities instituting speech codes, corporations removing historical artworks, publishers withdrawing books—all in response to pressure from social justice advocates. <span class="highlight-sophistication">The mechanism is concerning: social pressure replaces argument-based persuasion as the method of determining what can be discussed.</span> Furthermore, <span class="highlight-evaluation">the speed of modern judgment through social media means nuance becomes impossible—people rarely distinguish between "I disagree with that statement" and "that person deserves professional ruin," yet both get coded as cancel culture.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, while pursuing social justice is legitimate, the tactic of weaponizing social consequences to silence debate does appear to have gone too far in certain instances.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this claim requires critical qualification. <span class="highlight-relevance">The framing of "debate silencing" risks presenting social justice backlash as a novel threat, while ignoring centuries during which marginalized groups were systematically excluded from debates.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">Before social media enabled collective action, women, racial minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals had virtually no platform to challenge mainstream discourse. Current visibility of social justice voices in debate is not the silencing of legitimate discourse; it is the belated inclusion of previously silenced perspectives.</span> Additionally, <span class="highlight-sophistication">the claim that social justice has "gone too far" often comes from speakers whose views are still widely published, debated in mainstream media, and taught in universities—hardly silenced.</span> Cancel culture predominantly affects those already with significant platforms; it rarely silences genuinely marginalized voices, only those with power seeking to maintain controversial positions without consequence. <span class="highlight-evaluation">The term "legitimate debate" masks a key question: whose voices count as legitimate? Social justice advocates would argue that debates excluding marginalized perspectives are, by definition, not legitimate.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, while some individuals have faced professional consequences for speech, characterizing this as social justice having "gone too far" overlooks the historical and ongoing exclusion of marginalized voices from debate itself.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-relevance">The most accurate assessment is conditional: social justice pursuit is justified and necessary, but some specific implementations have become excessive.</span> The cause—fighting discrimination and amplifying marginalized voices—is legitimate. The original tactic—calling out harm, demanding accountability—was justified. <span class="highlight-evaluation">However, when pursuit of accountability extends to professional destruction, when institutions become afraid to engage with contested ideas, when people cannot articulate nuanced positions without being categorized as enemies, then tactics have exceeded justified bounds.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">The problem is not social justice itself but the confusion between accountability and punishment, between challenging ideas and destroying people.</span> A legitimate debate about sex-based versus gender-identity rights can exist without canceling either side. Institutional engagement with historical complexity can acknowledge past harms without erasing history entirely. <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, social justice activism hasn't inherently gone too far—its core aim of including marginalized voices in debate is necessary—but specific implementations, particularly cancel culture and institutional overcorrection, sometimes have exceeded justified limits.</span>

        <h2>SECTION 4: KEY LEARNING POINTS</h2>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>AVOIDING MEMORIZED EXAMPLES:</strong>
            <p>Notice we discuss cancel culture conceptually rather than naming specific celebrity cases. Why? Because celebrity cancellations are surface examples; the real argument is about mechanisms: "social pressure replaces argument-based persuasion," "speed prevents nuance," "fear of consequences creates self-censorship." These are chosen to prove the argument about legitimacy of debate, not because we remember famous cases.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>HANDLING CONTESTED TOPICS:</strong>
            <p>With controversial questions, the key is showing you understand why both sides believe what they believe, not choosing a side. Notice how this essay acknowledges both: "cancel culture creates real chilling effects" (validating Side A) AND "marginalized groups were historically excluded" (validating Side B). This prevents the essay from being dismissed as one-sided.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>PRACTICE:</strong>
            <p>For your next controversial question: (1) State both positions clearly; (2) Find the strongest evidence for each; (3) Identify where they genuinely conflict; (4) Show a third, more nuanced position. This structure demonstrates sophisticated thinking even on polarized issues.</p>
