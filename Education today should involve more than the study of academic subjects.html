    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Education today should involve more than the study of academic subjects as the world has become so <strong>mercurial, messy, and multidisciplinary</strong> that academic exposure alone, if not coupled with an exploration of more <strong>creative fields</strong> (like art, drama, music), will not <strong>place a student in good stead to navigate its complex challenges</strong>.</li>
        <li>b. Education today should involve more than the study of academic subjects as it is the best medium governments have to <strong>impart life skills</strong> to and <strong>instil lifelong values</strong> in its populace <strong>across the board</strong> and at <strong>a young age</strong>, ensuring students emerge as <strong>well-rounded adults</strong> rather than book-smart but immoral and inept children.</li>
        <li>c. Education today need not involve more than the study of academic subjects as academics are the <strong>core area of responsibility</strong> of any educational institute, whereas non-academics by definition have never been and need not now be seen as their concern.</li>
        <li>d. Education today should not involve more than the study of academic subjects as subjects whose essence cannot be <strong>crammed into a textbook</strong> or <strong>conveyed by a teacher</strong> are better encountered organically, outside the school walls, while <strong>institutionalising</strong> them would ruin the experience.</li>
    </ul>
