            <strong>Question 12 (2022):</strong> 'It is not winning, but taking part, which matters.' How acceptable is this as an approach to life?
        </div>

        <p>The Olympic motto "Citius, Altius, Fortius"—faster, higher, stronger—embodies humanity's eternal pursuit of excellence and victory. Yet Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympics, also championed the belief that "the important thing is not winning but taking part." This philosophical tension between participation and victory reflects one of the most enduring debates about how we should approach life's challenges. While the sentiment that participation matters more than winning contains valuable wisdom about character development and inclusivity, it becomes problematic when taken as an absolute principle, potentially undermining excellence, personal growth, and societal progress.</p>

        <p>The participatory ethos deserves recognition for its emphasis on character development and personal fulfillment. When individuals focus on engagement rather than outcomes, they often discover intrinsic rewards that transcend external validation. Consider the amateur marathon runner who crosses the finish line after five hours, beaming with pride despite finishing far from first place. Their joy stems not from comparative success but from personal achievement—conquering self-doubt, maintaining discipline throughout months of training, and pushing through physical barriers. This approach cultivates resilience, self-knowledge, and genuine satisfaction that victory alone cannot guarantee. Research in positive psychology consistently demonstrates that intrinsic motivation leads to greater long-term satisfaction than extrinsic rewards, suggesting that participation-focused mindsets may indeed yield deeper fulfillment.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, emphasizing participation over victory promotes inclusivity and broader social engagement. In educational contexts, this philosophy encourages students of varying abilities to engage with subjects without fear of judgment or failure. Singapore's recent educational reforms, which have de-emphasized rankings and standardized testing in favor of holistic development, reflect recognition that learning environments flourish when participation is valued over performance. Similarly, in workplace settings, organizations that celebrate effort and engagement often foster more collaborative, innovative cultures than those fixated solely on competitive outcomes. This approach democratizes opportunity, ensuring that contribution and growth are accessible to all, regardless of natural talent or circumstances.</p>

        <p>However, the absolute prioritization of participation over winning becomes deeply problematic when it discourages excellence or obscures the reality that outcomes matter profoundly in many life domains. While participation may be its own reward, many of humanity's greatest achievements have emerged from individuals and societies driven by the desire to win, excel, and surpass previous limits. Medical breakthroughs that save millions of lives result from researchers determined not merely to participate in scientific inquiry but to achieve decisive victories over disease. Economic prosperity, which enables social welfare and opportunity, depends on businesses and nations that compete successfully rather than simply taking part in global markets.</p>

        <p>The "participation trophy" phenomenon in contemporary Western societies illustrates the potential dangers of this philosophy when taken to extremes. Children who receive recognition regardless of effort or achievement may develop unrealistic expectations about life, entering adulthood unprepared for environments where performance determines opportunities. In highly competitive societies like South Korea or Singapore, students understand that academic performance directly impacts university admission, career prospects, and life outcomes. While this creates pressure, it also cultivates work ethic, excellence, and realistic understanding of meritocratic systems.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the pursuit of victory often catalyzes personal growth in ways that mere participation cannot. Athletes who train intensively for Olympic gold develop not only physical capabilities but mental toughness, strategic thinking, and profound self-discipline. The demanding standards required for excellence force individuals to discover their true potential and develop capabilities they never knew they possessed. Michael Jordan's legendary competitiveness, while sometimes problematic, drove him to basketball greatness that inspired millions and redefined what was considered possible in the sport.</p>

        <p>The most mature approach recognizes that both participation and winning serve essential functions depending on context and life stage. For children developing fundamental skills and confidence, emphasizing participation prevents discouragement and promotes exploration. For students learning collaboration and creativity, process-focused evaluation may yield better educational outcomes than purely competitive assessment. However, in professional contexts, competitive endeavors, and situations where excellence directly impacts others' welfare, the pursuit of victory becomes not just acceptable but morally necessary.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the healthiest life philosophy integrates both values: cherishing the courage to participate while maintaining honest recognition that excellence and achievement matter profoundly. The surgeon entering the operating room should be driven by the determination to win against disease, not merely to participate in medical practice. The parent raising children should focus on the quality of outcomes—raising ethical, capable adults—not simply on the effort of parenting. True wisdom lies in knowing when to emphasize each value and recognizing that the highest human achievements emerge when meaningful participation serves the pursuit of worthy victories.</p>
