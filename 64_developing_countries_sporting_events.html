            Question #64 (2016): Considering the money involved, should developing countries be allowed to host major sporting events?
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="essay-content">
        <p>The spectacle of major sporting events like the Olympics and FIFA World Cup captivates billions worldwide, but the question of whether developing countries should host these extravaganzas is increasingly contentious. While the financial burden can be overwhelming, developing nations should indeed be allowed to host major sporting events, provided they demonstrate genuine capacity and receive appropriate international support, as the potential benefits extend far beyond mere economics.</p>

        <p>The primary concern surrounding developing countries hosting major sporting events is undeniably financial. The costs are staggering—Brazil spent over $15 billion on the 2014 World Cup and $20 billion on the 2016 Olympics, while South Africa invested $4 billion in the 2010 World Cup. For nations grappling with poverty, inadequate healthcare, and educational deficits, such expenditure appears unconscionable. Critics rightfully argue that these resources could address pressing social needs, build schools, hospitals, and infrastructure that directly improves citizens' lives. The stark juxtaposition of gleaming stadiums against impoverished favelas in Brazil exemplifies this moral dilemma. Moreover, developing countries often lack the existing infrastructure, necessitating massive additional investments in transportation, accommodation, and security systems that may have limited post-event utility.</p>

        <p>However, the economic argument against developing countries hosting major sporting events oversimplifies a complex equation that includes substantial long-term benefits. These events can catalyze infrastructure development that serves communities for decades. South Africa's investments in transportation networks, stadiums converted to community facilities, and telecommunications improvements continue benefiting the nation. The tourism boost, while temporary during the event, can establish a country as a viable destination, generating sustained revenue. The 2010 World Cup elevated South Africa's international profile, increasing subsequent tourism by millions of visitors. Furthermore, these events create employment opportunities—from construction to hospitality services—providing income for thousands of workers and stimulating local economies.</p>

        <p>Beyond economics, major sporting events offer developing countries invaluable intangible benefits that justify the financial investment. They provide a platform for global recognition, allowing nations to showcase their culture, capabilities, and potential to international audiences. This soft power dividend can attract foreign investment, forge diplomatic relationships, and challenge negative stereotypes. The 2010 World Cup demonstrated Africa's capacity to host world-class events, fundamentally altering perceptions of the continent. National pride and unity generated by successfully hosting prestigious events can be transformative, fostering social cohesion and inspiring citizen confidence in their country's future. These psychological and social benefits, while difficult to quantify, contribute significantly to national development.</p>

        <p>The key lies not in denying developing countries the opportunity to host major sporting events, but in ensuring responsible hosting that maximizes benefits while minimizing waste. International sporting bodies must reform their requirements, reducing extravagant demands that necessitate excessive spending. The International Olympic Committee's recent acceptance of distributed hosting and use of existing facilities represents progress in this direction. Developing countries should be encouraged to propose realistic, sustainable hosting models that align with their development priorities. Technical assistance and financial support from international organizations can help ensure events contribute meaningfully to long-term development rather than creating unsustainable debt burdens.</p>

        <p>Additionally, transparency and accountability mechanisms must be strengthened to prevent corruption and ensure funds are spent effectively. The FIFA scandals surrounding World Cup hosting decisions highlight the need for rigorous oversight. When properly managed, with international support and realistic expectations, major sporting events can serve as catalysts for development rather than impediments to progress.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, developing countries should be allowed to host major sporting events, but within a reformed framework that prioritizes sustainability and development outcomes over prestige and profit. The solution is not exclusion but inclusion with proper safeguards. When responsibly managed, these events can provide developing nations with unique opportunities for growth, recognition, and transformation that extend far beyond the immediate financial costs. The goal should be ensuring that every dollar spent serves not just the event, but the enduring benefit of the people and communities who call these nations home.</p>
