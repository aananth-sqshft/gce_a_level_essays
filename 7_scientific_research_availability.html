        <div class="word-count">
            Question #7 | Science & Technology | Justification Question | Universal Focus
        </div>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> 'The results of scientific research should be available to everyone.' How far do you agree?</p>

        <h2>SECTION 1: Initial Thought Process & Approach</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: First Impressions</h3>
        <p><strong>Question Type (VIPERCJ):</strong> This is a <span class="highlight-relevance">JUSTIFICATION question</span>—asking about moral/ethical rightness. Is it ethically correct that research results be universally available?</p>

        <p><strong>Core Tension:</strong> The word <span class="highlight-relevance">"should"</span> signals normative debate. The statement assumes universal access is desirable, but barriers exist: intellectual property, commercial interests, cost, practical distribution.</p>

        <p><strong>Two Clear Sides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Side A (Should be universally available):</strong> Science is funded by public money (taxes); results represent collective human knowledge; access determines who benefits (health outcomes, economic opportunity); restricting creates injustice.</li>
            <li><strong>Side B (Cannot/should not be universally available):</strong> Intellectual property protects researcher investment; commercial interests fund research; some knowledge is dangerous if universal; practical distribution is impossible.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Global Context:</strong> Particularly relevant for developing nations where lack of access to research limits development; also relevant for proprietary medical research, pharmaceutical pricing, and open access debates.</p>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>CRITICAL ANNOTATION FOR YOUR LEARNING:</strong>
            <p>Started by asking "What does 'should' mean ethically?" and "What are the barriers to access?" rather than "What do I know about scientific research?" This question-first approach prevents memorized examples about specific research or discoveries. Instead, the focus is on the PRINCIPLE: access to knowledge and its justice implications.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Keyword Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Results":</strong> Findings, conclusions, published research. Can mean data, papers, discoveries, applications.</li>
            <li><strong>"Scientific research":</strong> Systematic investigation in natural sciences. Ranges from pure theory to applied (medical, engineering).</li>
            <li><strong>"Available":</strong> Accessible, obtainable, free from cost barriers. Implies universal provision.</li>
            <li><strong>"Everyone":</strong> All people, regardless of wealth, geography, profession. Implies no discrimination.</li>
            <li><strong>"Should":</strong> Ethical/moral obligation. Not just practical but normative claim about what is right.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Conceptual Framing</h3>
        <p>What is this question REALLY asking? <span class="highlight-relevance">Is universal access to scientific knowledge a moral imperative based on human rights and justice, or are restrictions justified by practical, commercial, and security concerns?</span></p>

        <h2>SECTION 2: Structural Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Topic Sentences (Balanced Scale 2+2 → Synthesis)</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Paragraph 1 (FOR—Should be universally available):</strong> "Scientific research should be universally available because it represents collective human knowledge funded largely through public investment (taxes, institutional grants), and restricting access perpetuates injustice by allowing knowledge that could save lives or create opportunity to remain inaccessible to those who cannot afford expensive journals, pharmaceuticals, or technologies, violating principles of equity and human dignity."</li>

            <li><strong>Paragraph 2 (FOR—Practical benefits of access):</strong> "Moreover, universal access generates concrete benefits: developing nations' researchers can access research without expensive subscriptions, accelerating global scientific progress; patients can access cutting-edge medical research; engineers can build on existing knowledge, reducing duplicative research and accelerating innovation, demonstrating that universal availability benefits not just individuals but accelerates collective scientific advancement."</li>

            <li><strong>Paragraph 3 (AGAINST—Justified restrictions):</strong> "However, some restrictions are justified: intellectual property protection incentivizes innovation by ensuring researchers/companies recoup investment; some scientific knowledge (biological weapons, dangerous pathogens) should be restricted for security; practical distribution costs are substantial; and commercial research funding depends on ability to monetize results, meaning eliminating restrictions might reduce funding for crucial medical and technological research."</li>

            <li><strong>Paragraph 4 (Synthesis—Conditional availability):</strong> "The principle of universal availability is justified for publicly-funded research and medical knowledge affecting human health, but commercial research and sensitive knowledge legitimately face restrictions; thus, research funded by public money should be universally accessible, while commercially-funded research may reasonably be restricted, and dangerous knowledge should be carefully controlled, suggesting that universal availability is a qualified principle applying to some research but not all."</li>

            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
            <p><span class="highlight-relevance">Scientific research should be universally available as a principle, particularly when publicly funded, because knowledge represents humanity's collective intellectual property and restricting it perpetuates unjust inequalities where access depends on wealth rather than need or merit</span>. However, the absolute claim that all research results should be universally available faces practical and ethical complications: intellectual property protections incentivize innovation; dangerous knowledge requires restriction for security; and commercial funding depends on profitability. <span class="highlight-relevance">A more nuanced position recognizes that publicly-funded research should be universally available as a principle of justice, while commercially-funded and security-sensitive research may legitimately face restrictions</span>. The extent of agreement depends on distinguishing between different types of research and acknowledging competing values (access, innovation incentives, security) that sometimes conflict.</p>

                <strong>INTRODUCTION ANALYSIS:</strong>
                <p><strong>Nuance established:</strong> Signals that the answer is conditional ("publicly-funded yes, commercial research different"). This avoids simplistic yes/no while establishing a principled position.</p>
                <p><strong>Justice framing:</strong> Opens with justice principle—"access determines who benefits"—which provides moral grounding for the argument.</p>

            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1 (FOR—Justice of universal access):</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p><span class="highlight-relevance">Scientific research should be universally available as a matter of justice because knowledge represents humanity's accumulated intellectual achievement, funded substantially through public investment, and restricting access creates unjust outcomes where life-saving medical knowledge remains inaccessible to those who cannot afford expensive journals or medicines</span>. Publicly-funded research (universities, government grants, tax-supported institutions) generates most foundational scientific knowledge; this research is funded by collective public resources, making the resulting knowledge morally collective property. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This public funding reveals that restricting access betrays the public's investment—taxpayers fund research, then must pay again to access results through expensive journals or medications, representing double-cost injustice where public investment serves private profit</span>. Moreover, restricting research perpetuates global inequality: researchers in wealthy nations can access expensive databases; researchers in developing nations cannot, slowing global progress and concentrating knowledge advantage in wealthy regions. Medical research provides the clearest justice case: knowledge showing effective disease treatment should be universally available because access determines who lives and who dies—a fundamentally unjust basis for life outcomes. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, publicly-funded research should be universally available because it represents collective knowledge funded through public resources, and restricting it perpetuates unjust inequalities of access based on wealth</span>.</p>

            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>Beyond justice arguments, universal availability generates concrete scientific and social benefits. <span class="highlight-relevance">When research is universally accessible, developing nations' scientists can build on existing knowledge without expensive subscription barriers, accelerating global scientific progress and reducing duplicative research</span>. Researchers in poor regions spend time rediscovering findings already published because they cannot afford access—wasteful inefficiency that universal access eliminates. Medical breakthroughs travel faster; engineers can innovate on existing technologies; educators can teach current knowledge. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This acceleration reveals that universal availability improves collective scientific progress; restricting access creates artificial barriers to human knowledge accumulation, slowing advancement that universal access would expedite</span>. Open-access journals and databases demonstrate this principle's feasibility and benefits: arXiv (physics preprints) and PubMed Central (medical research) provide free, rapid access, enabling faster knowledge diffusion and collaboration than traditional restricted journals. Furthermore, universal access democratizes science by allowing non-professionals to engage with research, reducing elitism and expanding who can participate in scientific discourse. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, universal availability should be adopted because it generates practical benefits—faster scientific progress, reduced duplication, democratized access—beyond the justice argument</span>.</p>

            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 3 (AGAINST—Legitimate restrictions):</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>However, <span class="highlight-relevance">the principle of universal availability faces legitimate practical and ethical limitations that prevent absolute application</span>. Intellectual property protections, while sometimes excessive, serve important functions: they incentivize innovation by ensuring researchers and companies recoup investment; pharmaceutical companies, for instance, spend billions developing drugs with no guarantee of profit—profits from restricted, expensive drugs fund future research. Eliminating access restrictions might reduce research funding by removing profit incentives, ultimately producing less innovation and fewer discoveries. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This protection reveals that incentive structures matter for knowledge production; while the existing system often generates unjust access barriers, some protection mechanism is necessary to maintain research investment and innovation rates</span>. Furthermore, some scientific knowledge should legitimately be restricted: biological weapons research, dangerous pathogens, and nuclear technology capabilities require careful control for security; universal availability would endanger global safety. Practical implementation also presents barriers: distributing research results globally requires infrastructure, translation, and adaptation—significant costs that cannot be entirely eliminated. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, while universal availability is desirable in principle, legitimate restrictions are justified for proprietary research, dangerous knowledge, and security-sensitive information, preventing universal availability from being an absolute principle</span>.</p>

            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 4 (Synthesis—Conditional principle):</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p><span class="highlight-relevance">The degree to which research should be universally available depends on distinguishing different research types and acknowledging competing values</span>. Publicly-funded research should be universally available as a principle of justice—taxpayers funded it, and restricting access betrays that investment while perpetuating inequality. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This distinction reveals that funding source determines moral obligation; publicly-funded research generates public goods that justice requires making universally accessible, while commercially-funded research represents private investment that market logic justifiably restricts</span>. Commercially-funded research (pharmaceutical development, proprietary technology) can justifiably be restricted temporarily to protect investors' returns, though time-limited patents that eventually expire balance profit incentives with eventual access. Security-sensitive knowledge (pathogens, weapons, critical infrastructure vulnerabilities) should be restricted to prevent harm, regardless of funding source. Thus, universal availability is not an absolute principle but rather a conditional one: applied robustly to publicly-funded research as matter of justice, applied moderately to commercially-funded research balancing incentives and access, and restricted for security-sensitive knowledge. <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, the claim that research "should be available to everyone" is partially correct—publicly-funded research should be universally accessible, but commercial and security-sensitive research legitimately face restrictions, making universal availability a qualified rather than absolute principle</span>.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 5: Key Learning Points</h2>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>YOUR MAIN WEAKNESS—Prevented Here</strong>
            <p>This essay avoids memorized research facts by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Question-first:</strong> Asked "What makes access a justice issue?" before thinking of examples.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples serve arguments:</strong> Public funding example proves "research funded by taxpayers creates obligation to share."</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation consistent:</strong> Every example explains HOW it demonstrates the principle, not just asserts relevance.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>PREVENTING REPETITION</strong>
            <p>Each paragraph approaches the issue differently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>P1 (Justice dimension):</strong> Why access is ethically required</li>
                <li><strong>P2 (Practical benefit dimension):</strong> Why access improves scientific progress</li>
                <li><strong>P3 (Constraint dimension):</strong> Why restrictions are sometimes justified</li>
                <li><strong>P4 (Synthesis dimension):</strong> How to balance competing values</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>CATEGORICAL THINKING = SOPHISTICATION</strong>
            <p>The essay's strength is creating categories (public research, commercial research, security-sensitive knowledge) with different rules. This shows the highest level of thinking—not "all or nothing" but "it depends." This is what examiners reward at Band 5.</p>
