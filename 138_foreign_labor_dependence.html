        <div class="word-count">Essay Length: 680 words | Question Type: V (Value) | Singapore-Specific</div>

        <h2>SECTION 1: Initial Thought Process</h2>
        <p><strong>Question Type (VIPERCJ):</strong> This is a <span class="highlight-relevance">VALUE (V) question</span> — asking about the importance/desirability of reducing foreign labor dependence. This requires evaluating what makes something valuable and whether this particular goal is worth prioritizing.</p>

        <p><strong>Core Tension:</strong> Singapore's economy fundamentally depends on foreign workers (construction, healthcare, domestic, technical sectors), yet dependence creates vulnerabilities (labor scarcity when immigration restrictions tighten, wage pressure on locals, social integration challenges). Is reducing dependence desirable, or are the costs too high?</p>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>Critical Note: Avoiding Memorized Positions</strong>
            <p>Don't start by thinking "Singapore has many foreign workers..." and listing facts. Instead, ask: "What makes reducing foreign labor dependence VALUABLE? What are the costs and benefits?" THEN find evidence supporting those specific arguments.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 3: The Model Answer (680 words)</h2>

        <div class="essay-text">
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">Singapore's economy rests substantially on foreign labor, with migrant workers comprising significant portions of construction, healthcare, domestic care, and service sectors</span>. <span class="highlight-sophistication">The question of whether reducing this dependence is desirable encapsulates a fundamental tension: local job protection versus economic competitiveness and growth</span>. <span class="highlight-relevance">While reducing dependence on foreign labor has genuine value in protecting Singaporean workers and building economic self-sufficiency, the degree to which this goal should be prioritized is limited by economic realities and demographic constraints that make significant reduction impractical</span>.</p>

            <p><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">Reducing foreign labor dependence is genuinely valuable for protecting local workers and building sustainable economic structures.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">When foreign workers flood sectors like construction and hospitality, the mechanism is increased labor competition that depresses local wages and reduces available jobs for Singaporean workers, particularly those with lower education levels.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">The construction industry exemplifies this dynamic:</span> foreign workers have increased from 12% to 45% of the construction workforce over two decades, correlating with wage stagnation for unskilled Singaporean workers. Furthermore, <span class="highlight-evaluation">building domestic labor capacity through education and skills training creates economic resilience — a self-sufficient workforce less vulnerable to global labor market shocks or immigration policy changes</span>. Reducing dependence also addresses social integration challenges: rapid demographic change from high migrant populations can create social cohesion strain and strains on housing, public services, and community spaces. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, reducing dependence on foreign labor is valuable for protecting local workers' employment prospects and creating more sustainable, self-sufficient economic structures.</span></p>

            <div class="annotation">
                <strong>Evaluation Focus:</strong> Notice the mechanism-based evaluation: "Foreign workers increase → competition increases → wages fall." This causal chain explains WHY reduction matters, not just that it does.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">However, the practical value of significantly reducing foreign labor dependence is substantially diminished by Singapore's demographic realities and economic constraints.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">Singapore's aging population and declining birth rate create a shrinking workforce precisely when economic growth requires labor expansion — the mathematical reality is that fewer Singaporean workers cannot fill all positions without economic contraction.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">Healthcare services exemplify this constraint:</span> Singapore lacks sufficient local nurses and healthcare workers; reducing migrant healthcare workers would compromise healthcare access and patient safety, harms that outweigh job protection benefits. Furthermore, <span class="highlight-evaluation">sectors dependent on foreign labor (domestic care, construction) serve essential functions that cannot be eliminated — reducing foreign workers without simultaneously reducing service demand is impossible, meaning "reduction" actually means either service degradation or automation, not job creation for locals.</span> Additionally, <span class="highlight-sophistication">higher costs of domestic labor compared to foreign workers create competitive disadvantages for Singapore's labor-intensive sectors in regional and global markets</span>, potentially causing business relocation and net job losses rather than gains. <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, whilst reducing foreign labor dependence has theoretical value, practical constraints mean significant reduction is neither achievable nor desirable given demographic decline and sectoral needs.</span></p>

            <div class="annotation">
                <strong>Qualified Affirmative:</strong> This paragraph doesn't deny the value identified in P1 — it explains why that value cannot justify large-scale reduction. This is sophisticated nuance.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Paragraph 3 (Synthesis):</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">A more nuanced assessment suggests that Singapore should pursue selective reduction in specific contexts whilst accepting structural dependence in others, rather than pursuing comprehensive reduction as a uniform policy goal</span>. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This selective approach recognizes that reducing dependence is valuable where foreign workers directly displace locals (certain construction and service sectors can shift toward productivity improvements and higher wages to attract local workers), but impractical where demographic gaps exist (healthcare, elderly care require sustained foreign labor)</span>. <span class="highlight-sophistication">The principle is context-dependent value: some sectors can be "Singaporeanized" through investment in education and technology; others cannot without service degradation.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">Moreover, the real policy lever is not "reduce foreign workers" but "improve wages and conditions for existing jobs" — making local employment more attractive through minimum wage standards, better benefits, and career progression, which naturally reduces relative foreign worker reliance without requiring arbitrary reduction targets.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, whilst reducing foreign labor dependence has genuine value as a principle, its importance is limited by demographic and economic realities that necessitate sustained, substantial foreign labor in specific sectors, suggesting that selective reduction complemented by wage improvement represents a more valuable and achievable policy approach than comprehensive dependence reduction.</span></p>

            <div class="annotation">
                <strong>Synthesis Innovation:</strong> Rather than just weighing both sides, this paragraph proposes a different framing: context-dependent value + wage improvement lever. This is sophisticated resolution that recasts the problem.

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>For Your Next Value Question</strong>
            <p>Value questions ("Is X desirable/valuable?") aren't just "do people value it?" They require you to analyze WHAT makes something valuable and WHETHER the proposed value outweighs competing concerns.</p>
            <p>This essay structure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>P1: Explains WHAT is valuable about reduction (local worker protection, self-sufficiency)</li>
                <li>P2: Explains WHY this value is limited (demographic/economic constraints)</li>
                <li>P3: Proposes when the value DOES apply (selective reduction) and when it doesn't (healthcare)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Practice this: For any value question, ask "Valuable FOR WHAT PURPOSE? Limited by WHAT CONSTRAINTS? Under WHAT CONDITIONS does the value apply?"</p>
