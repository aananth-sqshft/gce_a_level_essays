        <h3 style="color: #d9534f; font-size: 16px;">Question:</h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 16px; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px;">
            "Consider the view that people imprisoned for crimes should lose all their rights."

        <!-- SECTION 1: THINKING PROCESS -->
        <h2>SECTION 1: Initial Thought Process & Approach</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: First Impressions (Raw Thoughts)</h3>
        <p>
            When I first read this question, several critical features jump out:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question type:</strong> This is a <span class="highlight-relevance">JUSTIFICATION question</span> (using VIPERCJ framework). The word "should" signals that I'm being asked about moral and ethical rightness, not about what currently happens.</li>
            <li><strong>Extreme language detected:</strong> The word <span class="highlight-relevance">ALL</span> is the key marker. "Lose ALL their rights" is an absolute, blanket statement. Extreme words always signal positions that need challenging and nuance.</li>
            <li><strong>Two clear sides emerge:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Side A (FOR):</strong> Criminals do forfeit rights; they deserve punishment; society's safety matters more</li>
                    <li><strong>Side B (AGAINST):</strong> Some rights are inalienable; humans retain fundamental dignity; ALL is too extreme</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gut instinct:</strong> The absolute word "ALL" suggests the most intelligent answer is NOT to take a hard line either way. The real answer is likely: "Some rights should be removed, but NOT all, and the extent should depend on crime severity."</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>CRITICAL ANNOTATION FOR YOUR DAUGHTER: The Thinking Process Matters</strong>
            <p>Notice how I am NOT immediately thinking "What examples do I know about prisons and criminal justice?" Instead, I am asking: <strong>"What is this question actually asking me to debate?"</strong></p>
            <p>This is the key to avoiding irrelevance. By identifying the question type (Justification), the extreme word (ALL), and the two sides, I've already figured out what arguments I need to make BEFORE thinking of any examples. This prevents the trap of building the essay around memorized examples rather than around what the question requires.</p>
            <p>Examples come AFTER I understand the debate. This ensures relevance.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Understanding Keywords Before Any Examples</h3>
        <p>
            Let me analyze each key term to understand what I'm actually being asked to debate:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Imprisoned for crimes":</strong> This doesn't mean all the same thing. Stealing food, theft, assault, and murder are all crimes, but vastly different in nature, severity, and implications.</li>
            <li><strong>"Should lose":</strong> This is asking about what is MORALLY justified, not what currently happens in practice. This is a normative (should) not descriptive (is) question.</li>
            <li><strong>"All their rights":</strong> Which rights? Human rights (dignity, freedom from torture)? Civil rights (voting, property)? Social rights (family contact, education)? The question assumes these can all be bundled together, but they're not the same.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>Key Insight: Breaking Down the Assumptions</strong>
            <p>By asking "what does each term really mean?", I've already identified assumptions the question makes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assumption 1: All criminals are equivalent (they're not)</li>
                <li>Assumption 2: All rights are equivalent (they're not)</li>
                <li>Assumption 3: Rights can be wholly removed (this is debatable)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each assumption can become the basis for a sophisticated argument. Rather than recycling generic points about prisons, I'm generating SPECIFIC arguments by challenging these assumptions.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Conceptual Framing - What Is This Question REALLY About?</h3>
        <p>
            This question is fundamentally asking: <strong>Where is the line between punishment and inhumanity?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The underlying tension is between:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Society's need:</strong> Justice, public safety, punishment that fits the crime</li>
            <li><strong>Individual's claim:</strong> Inalienable human dignity, even when they've committed crimes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The word "ALL" forces us to confront an extreme: If criminals lose ALL rights, what does that mean? Can they be tortured? Starved? Denied medical care? Most people would say "no, that goes too far," which means the position in the question is already revealing itself as too absolute.
        </p>

            <p>See how each dimension (Social, Psychological, Economic, Moral, etc.) generates a DIFFERENT argument? And each polarity (Value, Impact, Effectiveness, etc.) generates yet another DIFFERENT angle?</p>
            <p>If I write 4 body paragraphs and each one approaches the question from a different lens (Social argument, Psychological argument, Effectiveness argument, Moral argument), I will have 4 genuinely different paragraphs with no repetition.</p>
            <p>This is how you prevent weak, repetitive arguments. Not by knowing more examples, but by exploring MORE ANGLES.</p>

            <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

            <p>
                The question of whether criminals imprisoned for their crimes should <span class="highlight-relevance">lose all their rights</span> presents a fundamental tension between society's legitimate need for justice and security, and the principle of inalienable human rights. While the <span class="highlight-relevance">extreme word "all"</span> invites us to consider a blanket removal of rights, a more nuanced examination reveals that the most defensible position is not binary but conditional: <span class="highlight-link">certain civil rights may be appropriately restricted during imprisonment, but fundamental human rights must remain inalienable regardless of crime severity, as both moral principles and empirical evidence demonstrate that absolute rights deprivation serves neither justice nor public safety.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="para-annotation">
                <strong>Introduction Analysis:</strong><br>
                <strong>What it does:</strong> Sets up the debate clearly, identifies the extreme word, and signals position without being dogmatic.<br>
                <strong>Relevance technique:</strong> Notice how the introduction directly addresses the question's use of "all" and positions the argument as nuanced rather than absolute. This signals to the reader: "I'm not going to give a simplistic yes/no answer; I'm going to explore the DEBATE."<br>
                <strong>Position clarity:</strong> The final link sentence uses question keywords and clearly states my answer: rights should NOT be lost ALL uniformly; some are inalienable.<br>
                <strong>Sophistication:</strong> Phrases like "inalienable human rights," "empirical evidence," and "fundamental tension" elevate the register above simple language.
            </div>

            <p><strong>BODY PARAGRAPH 1 (FOR SIDE - Arguments Supporting Rights Removal)</strong></p>

            <p>
                One compelling argument in favor of <span class="highlight-relevance">removing prisoners' rights</span> is rooted in the concept of the social contract: when individuals commit serious crimes—particularly violent offenses that harm others—they violate the foundational agreement that binds society together. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This violation creates a legitimate justification for withdrawing the legal protections that society extends to its members, as the criminal has demonstrated a willingness to ignore others' most fundamental rights.</span> Consider the case of violent offenders: a person who brutally assaults another has forfeited their claim to fair treatment precisely because they denied their victim basic human dignity. <span class="highlight-evaluation">The logic here is proportional—those who disregard others' rights cannot reasonably expect their own rights to remain intact.</span> Furthermore, imprisonment itself requires restricting certain rights (freedom of movement, privacy, association) for practical security reasons. Some argue that extending this logic to ALL rights represents a consistent application of the punishment principle: if the criminal has already surrendered their freedom, why should they retain other protections? <span class="highlight-link">From a retributive justice perspective, therefore, one could argue that criminals should lose rights as proportional consequence for their violations of others' rights.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="para-annotation">
                <strong>Paragraph 1 Analysis:</strong><br>
                <strong>Structure breakdown:</strong> Topic sentence (1) → Conceptual explanation of social contract (2) → Example of violent crime (2) → Evaluation of why this justifies rights removal (2) → Link (1) = ~220 words<br>
                <strong>How example was chosen:</strong> NOT because "I know about violent crime." Rather, because my argument is "social contract violation justifies rights removal," I needed an example that SPECIFICALLY shows how someone violated others' rights. Violent assault is the PERFECT example to prove this argument.<br>
                <strong>Evaluation technique:</strong> After each example, I explain the mechanism: "The logic here is proportional..." This shows HOW the example proves the point, not just that it's related to the topic.<br>
                <strong>Avoiding irrelevance:</strong> Everything in this paragraph serves the argument "retributive justice justifies rights removal." Nothing drifts into "prisons are bad" or "criminals are dangerous" (those are different points). Tight focus = relevance.<br>
                <strong>Word choice lessons:</strong> Notice "forfeited their claim" instead of "gave up"; "proportional" instead of "fair"; "legitimate justification" instead of "good reason." These are more sophisticated than simple words.
            </div>

            <p><strong>BODY PARAGRAPH 2 (FOR SIDE - Public Safety Argument)</strong></p>

            <p>
                A second argument supporting rights removal emphasizes practical security and public safety. <span class="highlight-relevance">Restricting prisoners' rights—particularly communication rights, visitation, and freedom of association—provides institutions with the control mechanisms necessary to maintain order and prevent violence within prisons.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">When prisoners retain rights to make phone calls, receive visitors, or access written materials, they can coordinate external crimes, communicate with gang members, or orchestrate prison violence—creating genuine security threats.</span> Supermax prisons, which restrict virtually all inmate rights, have demonstrably lower rates of internal violence and escape attempts than traditional facilities. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This empirical correlation suggests that rights removal does achieve its stated goal of institutional control.</span> Moreover, considering the victims of crime and their families, one might ask: should their safety and closure take priority over the comfort and autonomy of those who victimized them? <span class="highlight-link">Thus, from a utilitarian perspective focused on minimizing harm and maximizing institutional safety, the removal of prisoners' rights can be pragmatically justified.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="para-annotation">
                <strong>Paragraph 2 Analysis:</strong><br>
                <strong>Different angle from Para 1:</strong> Para 1 used retributive justice logic; Para 2 uses utilitarian/practical safety logic. These are genuinely different arguments, not repetition.<br>
                <strong>Example selection:</strong> "Supermax prisons" isn't mentioned because I memorized it. It's mentioned because my argument is "rights restriction achieves security," and supermax is the PERFECT example that specifically illustrates this claim.<br>
                <strong>Evaluation quality:</strong> Notice "This empirical correlation suggests..." This explains the causal link: fewer rights → less coordination of crime → lower violence. The evaluation shows the mechanism, not just that supermax exists.<br>
                <strong>Link precision:</strong> Ends with "removal of prisoners' rights can be pragmatically justified." Uses question keywords explicitly. Makes clear this paragraph answers: "Should they lose rights?" → "Yes, for safety reasons."<br>
                <strong>Balancing both sides:</strong> I'm presenting the strongest arguments for rights removal because a good essay doesn't strawman the opposing view. Presenting strong FOR arguments makes my eventual AGAINST arguments more persuasive.
            </div>

            <p><strong>BODY PARAGRAPH 3 (AGAINST SIDE - Human Rights Are Inalienable)</strong></p>

            <p>
                However, these arguments overlook a foundational moral principle: <span class="highlight-relevance">certain human rights are inalienable—meaning they cannot be legitimately removed without destroying the very concept of human dignity.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">The distinction is crucial: while civil rights (voting, movement, property) can be suspended during imprisonment because they represent participation in society, human rights (freedom from torture, right to healthcare, basic safety) cannot be suspended because they define what it means to be treated as human rather than as an animal or object.</span> The history of prison abuse—from the torture at Abu Ghraib to the inhumane conditions documented in numerous countries—reveals what happens when societies attempt to remove ALL rights: they create systems of degradation that violate international law and ethical standards. <span class="highlight-evaluation">These examples demonstrate that the pathway toward removing all rights inevitably leads to inhumanity, because once we accept that some rights can be removed, the boundary between "appropriate restriction" and "barbarism" becomes arbitrary and subject to abuse.</span> Admittedly, some restriction of prisoner rights is necessary for security; however, basic rights to healthcare, to freedom from torture, to minimal dignity—these transcend the criminal justice system. <span class="highlight-link">A society that removes ALL rights from criminals does not defend justice; it abandons the moral principles that distinguish civilized justice systems from vengeance.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="para-annotation">
                <strong>Paragraph 3 Analysis:</strong><br>
                <strong>Transitional strategy:</strong> Starts with "However, these arguments overlook..." This smoothly shifts from FOR to AGAINST without being abrupt.<br>
                <strong>Conceptual depth:</strong> The inalienable rights / civil rights distinction is sophisticated and shows genuine understanding. This isn't memorized; it's a principle that logically challenges the previous arguments.<br>
                <strong>Example evaluation:</strong> Abu Ghraib isn't just mentioned; the paragraph explains WHY it matters: "reveals what happens when societies attempt to remove ALL rights." The evaluation shows the CAUSAL consequence of the position being criticized.<br>
                <strong>Acknowledging counterarguments:</strong> "Admittedly, some restriction of prisoner rights is necessary..." This qualifier shows balanced thinking and prevents the paragraph from looking one-sided.<br>
                <strong>Distinguishing positions:</strong> Civil rights vs human rights distinction shows nuance—NOT saying "no rights should ever be restricted," but "some rights are categorically different."<br>
                <strong>Word choice:</strong> "barbarism," "inalienable," "transcend," "vengeance"—sophisticated vocabulary that elevates the argument.
            </div>

            <p><strong>BODY PARAGRAPH 4 (AGAINST SIDE - Effectiveness Argument with Evidence)</strong></p>

            <p>
                Beyond the moral argument lies a practical reality that contradicts the safety justification: <span class="highlight-relevance">removing all prisoners' rights is counterproductive to the actual goal of public safety and successful reintegration.</span> Empirical research on prison systems reveals a striking pattern: <span class="highlight-evaluation">countries that maintain certain prisoner rights—such as Norway, which allows education, family contact, and rehabilitation programs despite removing freedom—achieve recidivism rates below 20%, while the United States, which severely restricts prisoner rights, experiences recidivism above 65%.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">This disparity illustrates a fundamental truth: prisoners who maintain some degree of dignity, connection to society, and opportunity for personal development are far more likely to reintegrate successfully and avoid returning to crime.</span> When individuals are treated as humans capable of change rather than as permanently destroyed beings stripped of all rights, they respond by becoming less dangerous, not more. Furthermore, prisoners released after experiencing absolute rights deprivation often emerge psychologically damaged and more desperate, paradoxically creating the very threats to public safety that rights removal supposedly prevents. <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, empirical evidence demonstrates that criminals should NOT lose all their rights, because maintaining certain rights actually makes society safer by enabling rehabilitation and reducing reoffending.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="para-annotation">
                <strong>Paragraph 4 Analysis:</strong><br>
                <strong>Refutation technique:</strong> This paragraph directly challenges the safety argument from Para 2. It says: "You claim rights removal increases safety, but evidence shows the opposite." This is sophisticated refutation, not just disagreement.<br>
                <strong>Data evaluation:</strong> The Norway (20%) vs USA (65%) comparison isn't thrown in randomly. The paragraph evaluates what this means: "This disparity illustrates..." The evaluation explains the causal mechanism—dignity enables rehabilitation.<br>
                <strong>Example selection logic:</strong> Norway is chosen specifically because it supports the argument "maintaining rights improves outcomes." Not because I memorized it; because it PROVES the specific claim being made.<br>
                <strong>Depth of evaluation:</strong> Goes beyond just stating statistics. Explains the psychological mechanism: "prisoners...emerge...more desperate..." This shows understanding of why the evidence matters.<br>
                <strong>Addressing the counterargument:</strong> "Paradoxically creating the very threats..." This shows I'm not ignoring the opposing view; I'm showing its self-contradiction.<br>
                <strong>Link precision:</strong> "criminals should NOT lose all their rights" directly answers the question. Uses keywords. Makes position explicit.
            </div>

            <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, the question of whether <span class="highlight-relevance">criminals should lose all their rights</span> reveals a false binary. The most defensible position is neither absolute removal nor retention of all rights, but rather a <span class="highlight-sophistication">contextual, proportional framework</span> in which the extent of rights restrictions varies with crime severity and rehabilitation potential. Some rights—particularly civil rights such as freedom of movement and voting—are appropriately suspended during imprisonment as part of the punishment itself. However, the inalienable human rights—to healthcare, dignity, freedom from torture, and basic human contact—must be preserved, as they define civilization itself. <span class="highlight-evaluation">Maintaining this distinction accomplishes what absolute rights removal cannot: it fulfills society's legitimate need for justice and security while preserving the moral standards that distinguish us from the very barbarism that criminals' actions represent.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, criminals should not lose ALL their rights; they should lose specific rights proportional to their crime, but retain fundamental human rights that form the foundation of any justice system worthy of the name.</span>

                <strong>Conclusion Analysis:</strong><br>
                <strong>Synthesis approach:</strong> Rather than choosing one side, the conclusion shows how BOTH considerations (justice AND human rights) are valid, but the solution is context-dependent, not absolute.<br>
                <strong>Nuanced position:</strong> This is more sophisticated than "yes" or "no." It shows understanding that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Different rights are different (civil vs human)</li>
                    <li>Crime severity matters</li>
                    <li>Context determines justice</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Measured tone:</strong> "Most defensible position" rather than "obviously correct answer" shows appropriate scholarly restraint.<br>
                <strong>Links to broader principles:</strong> Ends by connecting to what justice systems should embody—this is a Band 5 touch (connecting to bigger ideas).<br>
                <strong>Final link:</strong> Restates position using question keywords to make absolutely clear that this essay has answered the question asked.

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>ADDRESSING HER MAIN WEAKNESS: Building Around Memorized Examples Rather Than Question Requirements</strong>
            <p>Your self-evaluation identified this as the primary issue: "I build points around memorized examples/essays → marker describes as IRRELEVANT."</p>
            <p>Look at how THIS essay avoids that trap:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1 (Question Analysis):</strong> I spent time understanding what the question ASKS BEFORE thinking of any examples. I identified: question type (Justification), extreme words (ALL), two sides (For/Against), and underlying tension (Justice vs Human Dignity).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2 (Argument Generation):</strong> ONLY THEN did I generate arguments: "Criminals forfeit rights through social contract violation" (Para 1), "Rights removal increases security" (Para 2), "Some rights are inalienable" (Para 3), "Rights removal doesn't actually improve safety" (Para 4).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3 (Example Selection):</strong> ONLY THEN did I ask: "What examples prove these specific arguments?" So I chose: violent crime (proves social contract argument), supermax prisons (proves security argument), Abu Ghraib (proves inalienable rights argument), Norway data (proves rehabilitation argument).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4 (Evaluation):</strong> After EACH example, I explained HOW it proves the claim: "This disparity illustrates a fundamental truth..." NOT just "Norway has low recidivism" but "...because maintaining dignity enables rehabilitation." The evaluation shows the causal mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The result:</strong> Examples feel chosen FOR the arguments, not the other way around. Relevance is maintained because examples serve the question's requirements, not memorized knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>How to Generate Non-Repetitive Points Using the Matrix Framework</strong>
            <p>Notice that all 4 body paragraphs argue the SAME OVERALL position ("criminals should not lose ALL rights"), yet they're completely different from each other:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Para 1: Retributive justice lens (Social/Moral dimension)</li>
                <li>Para 2: Utilitarian security lens (Practical/Political dimension)</li>
                <li>Para 3: Human rights principle lens (Moral/Rights dimension)</li>
                <li>Para 4: Empirical effectiveness lens (Scientific/Evidence dimension)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why don't they repeat? Because each one approaches the question from a DIFFERENT DIMENSIONAL LENS. Instead of generating arguments from "what do I know about prisons," I generated them from "what angles can I approach this question from?"</p>
            <p>For your next essay: Use SPERMS (Social, Political, Economic, Religion, Moral, Science) to generate your 4 arguments. If your topic is, say, "Social media is harmful," your paragraphs could be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Para 1: SOCIAL dimension (mental health, relationships)</li>
                <li>Para 2: POLITICAL dimension (misinformation, power dynamics)</li>
                <li>Para 3: ECONOMIC dimension (data exploitation, business model harms)</li>
                <li>Para 4: PSYCHOLOGICAL dimension (addiction, dopamine feedback loops)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Different dimensions = genuinely different paragraphs = no repetition.</p>

            <strong>Achieving Full Length Without Padding: The 200-Word Paragraph Formula</strong>
            <p>You mentioned potentially struggling to write full-length responses. Notice how this essay reaches 750 words without feeling padded:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intro (~90 words) sets up debate</li>
                <li>Para 1 (~180 words) = Topic (1) + Concept (50) + Example (50) + Evaluation (50) + Link (30)</li>
                <li>Para 2 (~190 words) = Topic (1) + Concept (50) + Example (50) + Evaluation (50) + Link (40)</li>
                <li>Para 3 (~200 words) = Topic (1) + Concept (60) + Example (50) + Evaluation (50) + Qualifier (20) + Link (20)</li>
                <li>Para 4 (~195 words) = Topic (1) + Concept (50) + Example (80) + Evaluation (40) + Link (25)</li>
                <li>Conclusion (~105 words) = Synthesis + Nuance + Final link</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The formula:</strong> If you write 4 body paragraphs with this structure, you'll naturally hit 700-800 words. No padding needed because each component contributes substance.</p>
            <p><strong>What prevents padding:</strong> The requirement that every paragraph serve the argument (Question-First rule). If you're asking "how does this prove my point," you won't include irrelevant filler.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>The Link Test: How Every Paragraph Passes Relevance Check</strong>
            <p>Look at how each paragraph ENDS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Para 1: "...criminals should lose rights as proportional consequence for their violations..." ✓ Uses question keywords, answers the question</li>
                <li>Para 2: "...removal of prisoners' rights can be pragmatically justified." ✓ Uses question keywords, states position clearly</li>
                <li>Para 3: "...abandons the moral principles that distinguish civilized justice systems from vengeance." ✓ Implicitly answers (if you abandon principles, you're NOT justified—ergo, should NOT lose ALL rights)</li>
                <li>Para 4: "...criminals should NOT lose all their rights, because maintaining certain rights actually makes society safer..." ✓ Direct answer with keywords</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The practice:</strong> After writing each paragraph, reread the final sentence. Ask: "Does this explicitly answer the question using the question's keywords?" If not, rewrite the final sentence to pass the Link Test.</p>
            <p>This simple practice alone will eliminate most relevance issues.</p>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>TRY THIS: Apply the Framework to a New Question</strong>
            <p>Pick one of these similar questions from your question bank and work through the SAME process before writing anything:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Question #25: "How far should countries have relations with others whose human rights record is poor?"</li>
                <li>Question #52: "'Rehabilitation, not punishment, should be the purpose of the justice system.' Discuss."</li>
                <li>Question #86: "How far should firms be allowed to limit their workers' rights when profits are at stake?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Step-by-step process (takes 15 minutes, not including writing the essay):</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Read the question THREE times (not once—read it multiple times to let nuances sink in)</li>
                <li><strong>Answer this immediately (without thinking of examples):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What type of question is it? (Use VIPERCJ—Value? Impact? Justification?)</li>
                        <li>What are the EXTREME or ABSOLUTE words? (all, never, always, only)</li>
                        <li>What ASSUMPTIONS does the question make that I can challenge?</li>
                        <li>What are the TWO SIDES of the debate?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use the Matrix to find 4 different angles:</strong> Generate one argument using SOCIAL dimension, one using MORAL, one using ECONOMIC, one using PSYCHOLOGICAL. (These become your 4 body paragraphs.)</li>
                <li><strong>NOW: Find examples that prove each argument:</strong> For your Social argument, find an example showing social consequences. For your Moral argument, find an example showing ethical principle. Etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Write your topic sentences BEFORE you write the body paragraphs.</strong> This forces you to be clear about what each paragraph will argue BEFORE you start writing.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>What this accomplishes:</strong> You'll generate arguments BEFORE thinking of examples, preventing the "I'm writing about memorized knowledge" trap. Your arguments will be diverse (different lenses) preventing repetition. Your examples will be chosen FOR your arguments, not the other way around.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- CLOSING -->
        <h2>Final Takeaway</h2>

        <p>
            This essay achieves Band 5 not because it includes impressive examples, but because it <strong>answers the question asked</strong> with <strong>nuanced, conceptual arguments</strong> that are <strong>supported by relevant illustrations</strong> and <strong>evaluated clearly</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For your next question: Invest 15 minutes in asking "What is this question asking?" before investing 60 minutes in writing. The planning determines the quality. An essay written from a deep understanding of the question's requirements will be relevant; an essay written from memorized knowledge will drift.
        </p>

        <p>
            You have the ability to write full-length essays with good explanation and elaboration. The missing piece is connecting those essays explicitly back to the specific question being asked. Once you master the "Question-First, Examples-Second" rule and the Link Test, your Band 5 essays will follow naturally.
