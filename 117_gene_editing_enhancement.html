            'Gene editing technology should be available for enhancement, not just disease prevention.' Discuss.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The advent of gene editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has opened unprecedented possibilities for manipulating human genetic code. While the scientific community has largely accepted therapeutic applications to prevent hereditary diseases, the prospect of using these tools for human enhancement remains deeply contentious. This essay argues that gene editing should remain primarily focused on therapeutic applications, as the risks and ethical concerns surrounding enhancement far outweigh any potential benefits.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Proponents of genetic enhancement argue that humanity has always sought to improve itself through various means, and gene editing represents merely the next evolutionary step. They contend that if we can eliminate genetic predispositions to diseases like Huntington's or cystic fibrosis, why should we not enhance human capabilities such as intelligence, physical strength, or longevity? From this perspective, genetic enhancement could reduce inequality by providing all individuals with optimal genetic foundations. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs like those at companies such as Neuralink have championed this transhumanist vision, arguing that genetic enhancement is necessary for humanity to remain competitive with artificial intelligence.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            However, the distinction between therapy and enhancement, while sometimes blurred, represents a crucial ethical boundary. Therapeutic gene editing addresses clear medical needs by correcting genetic defects that cause suffering and premature death. Enhancement, conversely, seeks to augment normal human capabilities beyond typical ranges. This fundamental difference carries profound implications for society. Unlike treating diseases, which aims to restore normal function, enhancement creates new categories of human capability that could exacerbate social stratification. If genetic enhancements become available to wealthy families but remain inaccessible to others, we risk creating a biological class system where genetic advantages compound existing socioeconomic privileges.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The technical risks associated with genetic enhancement are also considerably greater than those for therapeutic applications. When editing genes to prevent specific diseases, scientists target well-understood genetic pathways with clear causal relationships. Enhancement, however, often involves complex traits influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors. Intelligence, athletic ability, and even longevity result from intricate interactions between numerous genetic variants, making enhancement interventions far more unpredictable. The infamous case of He Jiankui, who attempted to enhance HIV resistance in twin girls in 2018, demonstrated how enhancement attempts can lead to unintended consequences, potentially creating new vulnerabilities while pursuing supposed improvements.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Furthermore, the societal implications of widespread genetic enhancement are profoundly troubling. Human diversity has been a source of strength for our species, enabling adaptation to changing environments and fostering innovation through varied perspectives and abilities. Genetic enhancement could lead to homogenization as parents gravitate toward similar "optimal" traits, reducing the genetic diversity that has historically served humanity well. Countries like Singapore, which already grapple with social pressures around academic and professional achievement, could see these pressures intensify if genetic enhancement becomes available, creating additional stress for families and individuals.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The regulatory challenges surrounding enhancement also present significant concerns. While therapeutic applications can be evaluated using established medical frameworks focused on safety and efficacy, enhancement lacks clear benchmarks for success or failure. How would regulators determine whether enhanced intelligence or physical capability justifies potential risks? The subjective nature of enhancement goals makes it difficult to establish consistent standards, potentially leading to a fragmented global landscape where different countries adopt varying approaches, creating "enhancement havens" similar to current issues with reproductive tourism.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Rather than pursuing enhancement applications, the scientific community should focus on perfecting therapeutic gene editing while establishing robust international frameworks for responsible research. Organizations like the World Health Organization have begun developing guidelines for human genome editing, but these efforts require strengthening before considering enhancement applications. The potential for therapeutic gene editing to eliminate hereditary diseases represents a genuine moral imperative that deserves our full attention and resources.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            In conclusion, while gene editing technology offers remarkable possibilities for human improvement, enhancement applications present risks and ethical challenges that currently outweigh potential benefits. The focus should remain on therapeutic applications that address clear medical needs while society develops appropriate frameworks for evaluating more controversial uses. The power to edit human genes demands extraordinary responsibility, and that responsibility is best exercised through careful, conservative approaches that prioritize healing over enhancement. Only by proceeding cautiously with therapeutic applications can we ensure that gene editing technology serves humanity's genuine needs rather than amplifying existing inequalities or creating new forms of biological discrimination.
