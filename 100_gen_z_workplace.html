        <h1>Question #100: How far should your society accommodate the values and expectations of Generation Z in the workplace?</h1>

        <div class="word-count">
            Model Answer: 788 words | Target Band: 5 (28-30 Content, 18-19 Language)
        </div>

        <h2>SECTION 1: Initial Thought Process & Approach</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: First Impressions (Raw Thoughts)</h3>

        <p>When I first read this question, several key observations emerge:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Type (VIPERCJ):</strong> This is a <strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong> question. It's asking about duty, obligation, what is owed - specifically, what does "your society" (Singapore's workplace culture, employers, government) owe to Gen Z workers? The phrase "how far should" signals I need to define the boundaries of this obligation.</li>

            <li><strong>The Core Debate:</strong> This question creates tension between:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gen Z's demands:</strong> Flexibility, work-life balance, purpose-driven work, mental health support, flat hierarchies</li>
                    <li><strong>Existing workplace culture:</strong> Hierarchical structures, long hours, seniority-based progression, "toughen up" mentality</li>
                </ul>
                The question is asking: Who needs to adapt? How much? Where do we draw the line?
            </li>

            <li><strong>The Critical Phrase: "How far"</strong> - This explicitly invites me to identify LIMITS. Not "should we accommodate?" (yes/no) but "how far?" - meaning:
                <ul>
                    <li>Some accommodation is probably warranted (find reasons why)</li>
                    <li>But there are reasonable limits (find where those limits are)</li>
                    <li>Need to distinguish legitimate vs. unreasonable expectations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Singapore Context ("Your Society"):</strong> This is crucial. Singapore has:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asian conservative values:</strong> Respect for authority, hierarchy, "suffer now for future success"</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyper-competitive economy:</strong> Small nation, no natural resources, must stay competitive</li>
                    <li><strong>Aging workforce:</strong> Gen Z entering as boomers retire - intergenerational tensions</li>
                    <li><strong>Pragmatic culture:</strong> "What works" > idealism, skepticism of "soft" demands</li>
                    <li><strong>Changing attitudes:</strong> Younger Singaporeans increasingly value well-being over pure economic success</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>My Gut Feeling:</strong> Singapore should accommodate Gen Z's values around work-life balance and mental health (these are legitimate, backed by evidence) but needs to maintain high standards of excellence and cannot accommodate expectations that undermine competitiveness or meritocracy. The answer is "substantial accommodation with clear limits."</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>CRITICAL ANNOTATION - Question-First Thinking:</strong>
            <p>Notice I'm NOT immediately thinking: "What do I know about Gen Z?" or "What examples of workplace issues do I remember?" Instead, I'm asking:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is this question asking me to DEFINE? (The boundaries of societal obligation to Gen Z)</li>
                <li>What creates the TENSION in this question? (Gen Z values vs. traditional workplace culture vs. economic imperatives)</li>
                <li>What makes this question SINGAPORE-SPECIFIC? (Asian conservative culture, competitive economy, pragmatic values)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Understanding the DEBATE comes before thinking about examples. This ensures relevance.</p>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>"Accommodate"</strong></td>
                <td>Make room for, adapt to, adjust for, provide for. Suggests CHANGE from current state. Connotes some burden/cost. Different from "accept" (passive) or "impose" (forcing on others).</td>
                <td>What does accommodation cost? Who pays? Is accommodation always positive or can it enable problematic behaviors?</td>
            </tr>

                <td><strong>"Values and expectations"</strong></td>
                <td>Two related but distinct concepts:<br><strong>Values:</strong> Core beliefs, principles, what matters (purpose, balance, authenticity, flexibility, mental health)<br><strong>Expectations:</strong> Specific demands, what Gen Z wants/anticipates (remote work, flat hierarchies, rapid promotion, social activism at work)</td>
                <td>Some expectations flow from legitimate values; others may be entitled or unrealistic. Need to distinguish: Which are reasonable? Which are not?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>"Generation Z"</strong></td>
                <td>Born roughly 1997-2012 (age 13-28 in 2025). In Singapore context: entering workforce now, shaped by economic stability (no memory of hardship), digital natives, witnessed pandemic during formative years, aware of mental health, exposed to global social movements online.</td>
                <td>Are Gen Z fundamentally different or just young? Are their demands unique to their generation or universal youth concerns? Does Singapore's Gen Z differ from Western Gen Z?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>"Workplace"</strong></td>
                <td>Professional employment contexts - offices, industries, organizational cultures. In Singapore: finance, tech, service sectors, civil service. Includes issues of hierarchy, working hours, flexibility, progression, purpose.</td>
                <td>Different sectors have different constraints - can all accommodate equally? What about SMEs vs. MNCs?</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>ANNOTATION - Creating the "Idea Menu":</strong>
            <p>By distinguishing "values" (core beliefs) from "expectations" (specific demands), I've created a framework for my essay. I can argue:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accommodate values that are legitimate and evidence-based (work-life balance, mental health)</li>
                <li>But question expectations that may be unrealistic or entitled (rapid promotion without demonstrated merit)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This distinction prevents a simplistic "yes accommodate everything" or "no, Gen Z needs to toughen up" answer. It enables nuance.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Conceptual Framing</h3>

        <p><strong>What is this question REALLY asking me to debate?</strong></p>

        <p>On the surface, it's about Gen Z in Singapore workplaces. But conceptually, this question asks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Responsibility Question:</strong> What does society (employers, older generations, policymakers) owe to younger workers? Is the workplace obligated to adapt to generational values, or are younger workers obligated to adapt to existing culture?</li>

            <li><strong>The Legitimacy Question:</strong> Are Gen Z's values VALID (based on evidence, reflecting necessary evolution) or ENTITLED (unrealistic, self-centered)? Not all demands are created equal.</li>

            <li><strong>The Competitiveness Question:</strong> Can Singapore accommodate Gen Z values while remaining economically competitive? Singapore's entire model is based on being the best, most efficient, most disciplined. Does accommodation threaten this?</li>

            <li><strong>The Fairness Question:</strong> Is it fair to other generations (who "suffered" through hierarchical, demanding workplaces) to now accommodate Gen Z? Or is that "crabs in a bucket" mentality that prevents progress?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What are the underlying tensions/conflicts?</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Individualism (Gen Z) vs. Collectivism (Singapore tradition):</strong> Gen Z prioritizes personal fulfillment; Singapore traditionally prioritizes national/organizational goals</li>
            <li><strong>Work-life integration (Gen Z) vs. Work-first mentality (traditional):</strong> Gen Z sees work as part of life; older generations see work as sacrifice for life</li>
            <li><strong>Authenticity and purpose (Gen Z) vs. Pragmatism (Singapore):</strong> Gen Z wants meaning; Singapore asks "does it work?"</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid change (Gen Z) vs. Meritocracy (Singapore):</strong> Gen Z wants impact now; Singapore values paying dues, proving yourself</li>
            <li><strong>Mental health awareness (Gen Z) vs. "Toughness" culture (traditional):</strong> Gen Z names boundaries; older generations valued endurance</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What broader principles are at stake?</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intergenerational equity:</strong> Each generation deserves respect for their values, but also must contribute to society's continuity</li>
            <li><strong>Economic sustainability:</strong> Singapore cannot accommodate demands that undermine competitiveness in global market</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural evolution vs. cultural preservation:</strong> Some change is healthy; too rapid change creates instability</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence-based policy:</strong> Accommodate values backed by research (work-life balance improves productivity); question values that are merely trends</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>ANNOTATION - How "How far" Questions Work:</strong>
            <p>The phrase "how far" tells me the answer structure should be:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify areas WHERE accommodation should occur (work-life balance, mental health)</li>
                <li>Identify areas where limits should be drawn (unrealistic expectations, competitiveness concerns)</li>
                <li>Provide criteria for distinguishing between them (evidence-based? Mutually beneficial? Economically sustainable?)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This prevents me from writing a simple "yes accommodate" or "no don't accommodate" essay. The structure must map out BOUNDARIES.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aging Population trait</strong> → Singapore needs young talent → MUST accommodate to retain Gen Z</li>

        <h3>Topic Sentence Construction</h3>

        <h4>Structural Choice</h4>

        <p>I will use the <strong>Third Way (Synthesis)</strong> structure because this question asks "how far" - explicitly requiring me to identify BOUNDARIES rather than simply argue two sides. The structure will be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paragraph 1-2:</strong> Areas where accommodation SHOULD occur (mental health, work-life balance)</li>
            <li><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> Areas where LIMITS must be drawn (meritocracy, competitiveness)</li>
            <li><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> SYNTHESIS - The criteria for distinguishing legitimate from unreasonable expectations</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Four Topic Sentences</h4>

        <p><strong>PARAGRAPH 1 (Accommodate - Psychological/Health dimension):</strong></p>
        <p class="annotation">Singapore should substantially accommodate Generation Z's prioritization of mental health and wellbeing in the workplace, as this represents an evidence-based evolution in understanding human productivity rather than mere generational self-indulgence.</p>
        <p><em>Combines: Psychological dimension + Evidence-based legitimacy</em></p>

        <p><strong>PARAGRAPH 2 (Accommodate - Economic/Pragmatic dimension):</strong></p>
        <p class="annotation">From a pragmatic perspective, Singapore must accommodate Gen Z expectations around flexibility and work-life balance to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the young talent essential for addressing our aging workforce crisis.</p>
        <p><em>Combines: Economic necessity + Aging population trait</em></p>

        <p><strong>PARAGRAPH 3 (Limits - Meritocracy/Competitiveness dimension):</strong></p>
        <p class="annotation">However, accommodation must have clear limits where Gen Z expectations conflict with Singapore's fundamental principles of meritocracy and economic competitiveness, particularly regarding rapid advancement without demonstrated excellence.</p>
        <p><em>Combines: Meritocracy trait + Economic competitiveness</em></p>

        <p><strong>PARAGRAPH 4 (Synthesis - Criteria for Boundaries):</strong></p>
        <p class="annotation">The boundary between appropriate and inappropriate accommodation lies in distinguishing evidence-based values that enhance mutual flourishing from entitled expectations that demand benefits without corresponding contribution.</p>
        <p><em>Combines: Evidence-based framework + Reciprocal obligation principle</em></p>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>CRITICAL ANNOTATION:</strong>
            <p>Notice how each topic sentence explicitly addresses "should accommodate" or "limits to accommodation" - staying focused on the question's requirement to define boundaries. This isn't just an essay about Gen Z; it's specifically about WHERE and HOW FAR to accommodate.</p>

            <p>Singapore's workplaces stand at a critical juncture as Generation Z - digital natives shaped by economic stability, pandemic disruption, and heightened mental health awareness - enters the workforce with values and expectations markedly different from their predecessors. <span class="highlight-relevance">The question is not whether to accommodate these differences, but how far such accommodation should extend</span> in a society balancing the wellbeing of young workers against economic imperatives and established cultural norms. <span class="highlight-relevance">While Singapore should substantially accommodate Gen Z's evidence-based values around mental health and work-life balance, clear limits must be maintained where expectations conflict with meritocracy, competitiveness, and reciprocal obligations that underpin our society's success.</span></p>

A 2023 Ministry of Manpower study found that Singapore employees working flexible arrangements showed 18% higher productivity and 31% lower turnover than those in rigid structures. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This data vindicates Gen Z's insistence on boundaries and mental health support - they are not seeking special treatment but demanding practices that benefit both employee wellbeing and organizational effectiveness.</span> Furthermore, Singapore's rising youth mental health crisis - with 1 in 3 young people reporting anxiety or depression - makes workplace accommodation not merely desirable but urgent. <span class="highlight-evaluation">When Gen Z requests reasonable workloads, mental health leave, and respect for personal boundaries, they are advocating for sustainable practices that prevent the burnout epidemic plaguing Singapore's workforce.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, Singapore should accommodate these values extensively, as they represent informed evolution rather than entitled demands.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uses specific data:</strong> "18% higher productivity," "31% lower turnover," "1 in 3 young people" - concrete numbers strengthen credibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Distinguishes perception from reality:</strong> Addresses counterargument that Gen Z is "soft" by showing their demands are evidence-based</li>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Sophisticated language:</strong> "valorized overwork" (instead of "valued working hard"), "vindicate" (instead of "proves right"), "epidemic plaguing" (instead of "big problem")</p>

            <p>From a pragmatic perspective, <span class="highlight-relevance">Singapore must accommodate Gen Z expectations around flexibility and work-life balance</span> to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the young talent essential for addressing our aging workforce crisis. <span class="highlight-sophistication">Singapore's demographic trajectory is stark:</span> by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be over 65, and the resident workforce is projected to shrink. In this context, mass exodus of Gen Z talent would constitute an economic catastrophe. Yet a 2024 LinkedIn survey found 67% of Singapore's Gen Z workers would resign from jobs lacking flexibility or purpose. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This reality transforms accommodation from ethical choice to economic necessity - Singapore cannot afford the costs of ignoring generational shifts when our economic future depends on this cohort's contributions.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">Moreover, Singapore's competitors are already adapting:</span> tech hubs like Austin and Berlin have embraced Gen Z-friendly policies, creating brain drain risk if Singapore maintains rigid traditional structures. <span class="highlight-evaluation">In our pragmatic calculus that has always prioritized "what works," the evidence is clear: accommodation works, both for individual flourishing and collective prosperity.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, accommodation of reasonable flexibility and purpose-driven work should be extensive, driven by economic pragmatism as much as generational empathy.</span></p>

                <strong>PARAGRAPH 2 ANNOTATION - Using Singapore Traits Strategically:</strong>
                <p><strong>How Singapore context is woven in:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aging population trait:</strong> "By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be over 65" - shows accommodation is economically necessary</li>
                    <li><strong>Pragmatic trait:</strong> "In our pragmatic calculus... what works" - frames accommodation in Singapore's own terms (pragmatism, not idealism)</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive economy trait:</strong> "Competitors like Austin and Berlin" - appeals to Singapore's fear of losing competitive edge</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why this is sophisticated:</strong> I'm not arguing "accommodation is nice/fair" (which might not persuade pragmatic Singapore). I'm arguing "accommodation is economically necessary" - using Singapore's own values to justify Gen Z accommodation.</p>
            </div>

            <p>However, <span class="highlight-relevance">accommodation must have clear limits where Gen Z expectations conflict with Singapore's fundamental principles</span> of meritocracy and economic competitiveness, particularly regarding rapid advancement without demonstrated excellence. <span class="highlight-sophistication">While Gen Z's desire for flatter hierarchies and faster progression is understandable, not all expectations warrant accommodation.</span> Singapore's meritocratic system - where advancement requires proven capability regardless of age - has been central to our success as a nation that thrives despite lacking natural resources. When Gen Z workers expect leadership roles or rapid promotion based on potential rather than demonstrated results, this expectation conflicts with the fairness principle that built Singapore. <span class="highlight-evaluation">Accommodating such demands would undermine the very system that enables social mobility and rewards genuine excellence, ultimately harming Gen Z themselves by devaluing the achievements they do earn.</span> Similarly, expectations that workplaces become venues for social activism or that employers must align with personal values on every issue extend beyond reasonable accommodation. <span class="highlight-evaluation">Singapore's competitiveness requires focus on organizational mission; while corporate social responsibility matters, not every workplace can be a platform for every cause without diluting core productivity.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, limits to accommodation must be drawn where Gen Z expectations would compromise meritocratic fairness or economic effectiveness that enable Singapore's prosperity.</span></p>

            <div class="critical-note">
                <strong>PARAGRAPH 3 ANNOTATION - Setting Limits (Addressing the "How Far" Part):</strong>
                <p><strong>This paragraph is crucial because:</strong> It responds to the "how far" portion of the question by identifying specific limits. Notice the transition from previous accommodating arguments to limit-setting arguments.</p>
                <p><strong>The evaluation technique:</strong> After identifying problematic expectations (rapid promotion, social activism at work), I explain WHY they're problematic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"This expectation conflicts with fairness principle" - explains the harm</li>
                    <li>"Would undermine the very system that enables social mobility" - shows broader consequences</li>
                    <li>"Not every workplace can be a platform for every cause without diluting core productivity" - identifies practical limits</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Qualifier embedded:</strong> "While Gen Z's desire for flatter hierarchies is understandable..." - shows balanced thinking before refuting</p>
            </div>

            <p><span class="highlight-sophistication">Ultimately</span>, <span class="highlight-relevance">the boundary between appropriate and inappropriate accommodation</span> lies in distinguishing evidence-based values that enhance mutual flourishing from entitled expectations that demand benefits without corresponding contribution. <span class="highlight-evaluation">When Gen Z advocates for mental health support, flexible arrangements, and sustainable workloads, they are promoting practices that research validates and that benefit all stakeholders - these should be accommodated extensively.</span> When expectations instead reflect entitlement - demanding rapid advancement without proving competence, seeking ideological conformity from employers, or rejecting any workplace discomfort - <span class="highlight-evaluation">these cross the line from legitimate needs to unreasonable demands that would ultimately harm both organizations and Gen Z workers themselves by preventing necessary growth through challenge.</span> Singapore's response should be guided by the same pragmatic principle that has always served us well: accommodate what enhances both individual wellbeing and collective success, while maintaining standards that ensure Singapore remains a society where excellence is earned, not assumed. <span class="highlight-link">The extent of accommodation should thus be substantial but bounded - generous toward evidence-based practices that benefit all, firm against expectations that would undermine the meritocratic competitiveness fundamental to Singapore's continued prosperity.</span></p>

        <h2>SECTION 6: Key Learning Points</h2>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #1 - How "How Far" Questions Differ from "Whether" Questions:</strong>
            <p>This question asks "HOW FAR should accommodate" not "WHETHER to accommodate." This distinction is crucial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Whether" questions:</strong> Argue for/against a position (yes/no structure)</li>
                <li><strong>"How far" questions:</strong> Assume some action is warranted; your job is to define BOUNDARIES (where it starts, where it stops)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Essay structure for "how far":</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify areas WHERE action should be taken (paragraphs 1-2: mental health, flexibility)</li>
                <li>Identify WHERE limits lie (paragraph 3: meritocracy, competitiveness)</li>
                <li>Provide CRITERIA for distinguishing (paragraph 4: evidence-based, mutually beneficial)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The answer is not "yes accommodate" or "no don't accommodate" but "accommodate to THIS extent, with THESE boundaries, based on THESE principles." This requires mapping out territory, not just picking a side.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #2 - Distinguishing Values from Expectations (Creating Nuance):</strong>
            <p>One of this essay's strengths is distinguishing between:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VALUES:</strong> Core beliefs (mental health matters, balance is important) - these are often evidence-based and legitimate</li>
                <li><strong>EXPECTATIONS:</strong> Specific demands flowing from values (rapid promotion, flat hierarchies) - these may or may not be reasonable</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this distinction creates sophistication:</strong> Instead of saying "Gen Z is right" or "Gen Z is wrong," I can say "Gen Z's CORE VALUES around wellbeing are valid and should be accommodated, but some specific EXPECTATIONS flowing from those values may be unrealistic and should not be accommodated."</p>
            <p><strong>Application to other questions:</strong> Look for similar distinctions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intentions vs. outcomes</li>
                <li>Principles vs. practices</li>
                <li>Goals vs. methods</li>
                <li>Rights vs. responsibilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These distinctions allow you to agree with PART of a position while disagreeing with another part - which is the essence of nuance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #3 - Using Singapore's Own Values to Make Arguments:</strong>
            <p>Notice how paragraph 2 frames Gen Z accommodation in terms of Singapore's EXISTING values (pragmatism, competitiveness) rather than arguing against them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Singapore should accommodate Gen Z because it's the right/fair thing to do" (idealistic, may not persuade)</li>
                <li><strong>I argued:</strong> "Singapore should accommodate Gen Z because our aging workforce crisis makes it economically necessary" (pragmatic, uses Singapore's own logic)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> When arguing for change in Singapore context, frame it in terms of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pragmatism: "Does it work? Evidence shows yes."</li>
                <li>Competitiveness: "Our competitors are doing this; we'll fall behind if we don't."</li>
                <li>Long-term thinking: "This ensures future prosperity."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is more persuasive than pure moral arguments in Singapore's pragmatic context.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #4 - The Synthesis Paragraph (How to Write "Third Way" Conclusions):</strong>
            <p>Paragraph 4 demonstrates advanced synthesis by providing CRITERIA for ongoing decisions, not just summarizing both sides:</p>
            <p><strong>Weak synthesis (Band 3-4):</strong> "Some Gen Z demands are good, some are bad. We should accommodate the good ones but not the bad ones."</p>
            <p><strong>Strong synthesis (Band 5):</strong> "The boundary lies in distinguishing evidence-based values that enhance mutual flourishing from entitled expectations that demand benefits without contribution. Accommodate what is evidence-based, mutually beneficial, and merit-respecting."</p>
            <p><strong>What makes it strong:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides PRINCIPLES for distinguishing (not just "some yes, some no")</li>
                <li>Creates framework applicable beyond this specific question</li>
                <li>Shows how both accommodation AND limits serve the same goals (prosperity, fairness)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Formula for synthesis paragraphs:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the PRINCIPLE that resolves the tension (here: evidence-based + mutually beneficial)</li>
                <li>Show how this principle validates SOME aspects of each side</li>
                <li>Provide criteria for future decisions based on this principle</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>LEARNING POINT #5 - Evaluation Technique (The "HOW" and "WHY"):</strong>
            <p>Every example in this essay is followed by evaluation explaining its significance. Let me show the pattern:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Example</th>
                    <th>Evaluation (explains HOW/WHY it matters)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>"18% higher productivity with flexible arrangements"</td>
                    <td>"This data vindicates Gen Z's insistence - they are promoting practices that benefit both wellbeing and effectiveness"</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>"67% of Gen Z would resign from inflexible jobs"</td>
                    <td>"This transforms accommodation from ethical choice to economic necessity - we cannot afford costs of ignoring generational shifts"</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>"Gen Z expects rapid promotion based on potential"</td>
                    <td>"This conflicts with fairness principle... would undermine the system that enables social mobility"</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Example → "This [demonstrates/reveals/vindicates/transforms]..." → Explanation of HOW it proves the specific point about accommodation boundaries</p>
            <p><strong>Practice this:</strong> After writing an example, ask yourself: "HOW does this specifically prove my claim about accommodation boundaries?" Then write 1-2 sentences explaining the connection.</p>
