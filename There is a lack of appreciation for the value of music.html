    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. There is a lack of appreciation for the value of music in <strong>pragmatic</strong> Singapore, as we only care about material, usually monetary forms of value to the exclusion of everything else, causing music's <strong>emotional benefits</strong> to go underappreciated.</li>
        <li>b. There is a lack of appreciation for the value of music in <strong>paternalistic</strong> Singapore, as efforts to <strong>induce a love for music in citizens</strong> or <strong>introduce music into the cultural scene</strong> have felt either half-hearted or heavy-handed, thereby turning us off the artistic field instead.</li>
        <li>c. There is no lack of appreciation for the value of music in <strong>post-materialist</strong> Singapore, as we are beginning to care about higher-order needs like a <strong>serene, stable, and stress-free mental state</strong> too, bringing music's value into the spotlight at last.</li>
        <li>d. There is no lack of appreciation for the value of music in <strong>pragmatic</strong> Singapore, as we are realising that music can be a <strong>lucrative source of economic gain</strong> and regarding it as being valuable after all.</li>
    </ul>
