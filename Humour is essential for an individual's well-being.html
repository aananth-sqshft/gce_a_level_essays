    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Humour is essential for an individual's well-being, as it affords us the ability to <strong>laugh in the face of life's adversities and absurdities</strong>, granting us a vital <strong>emotional peace</strong> we cannot live without.</li>
        <li>b. Humour is essential for an individual's well-being, as its propensity to <strong>thaw icy situations and temper tensions</strong> allows it to act as a social <strong>lubricant</strong> that we social creatures need to form meaningful relationships.</li>
        <li>c. Humour is not essential for an individual's well-being, as its <strong>entertaining effects</strong> amount to mere <strong>escapism</strong>, freeing us from real-world responsibilities while problems fester, and thus do not do all that much to obliterate obstacles to our well-being.</li>
        <li>d. Humour is not essential for an individual's well-being, as the health of one's <strong>physical body</strong> is determined by a multitude of factors, of which the presence or absence of <strong>laughter</strong>--a satisfying but ultimately superficial source of relief--is but one.</li>
    </ul>
