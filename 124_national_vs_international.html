            <strong>QUESTION ANALYSIS SUMMARY</strong>

            <p><strong>Key terms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>"To what extent" = nuanced answer required, not absolute prioritization</li>
                    <li>"Your society" = Singapore context essential - small nation dependent on international system</li>
                    <li>"Prioritize national interests over" = zero-sum framing (challenge this!)</li>
                    <li>"Multipolar world" = post-US hegemony; China-US competition; regional powers matter more</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Core debate:</strong> Should Singapore prioritize its own national interests (sovereignty, security, prosperity) over international cooperation (multilateral engagement, rule-based order), or are these actually interdependent rather than competing?</p>
            <p><strong>My position:</strong> False dichotomy - for Singapore, national interests are BEST SERVED by international cooperation. Small nations need rules-based multilateral system. However, must protect core sovereignty in specific domains. Answer: high degree of international cooperation IS the national interest, with exceptions for vital security/sovereignty.</p>

                <li><strong>Small city-state:</strong> Population 5.6M, no hinterland, no natural resources - survival depends on international system</li>
                <li><strong>Trade-dependent:</strong> Trade 3x GDP; port, aviation hub; financial center - needs open global economy</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerable:</strong> Geographically small, militarily weak alone, water/food dependent on neighbors</li>
                <li><strong>Pragmatic:</strong> Prioritizes what works; non-ideological; flexible foreign policy</li>
                <li><strong>ASEAN member:</strong> Regional integration central to security and prosperity</li>

        <h2>SECTION 3: Model Answer (Band 5)</h2>

        <div class="essay-text">
            <p>
                <span class="highlight-relevance">The question of whether Singapore should prioritize national interests over international cooperation</span> rests upon a false dichotomy that obscures a fundamental truth: <span class="highlight-sophistication">for small, trade-dependent city-states like Singapore, robust international cooperation is not antithetical to national interest but rather its most crucial instrument of realization.</span> In the contemporary multipolar landscape characterized by intensifying great power competition between the United States and China, shifting regional dynamics, and proliferating transnational challenges, <span class="highlight-relevance">Singapore's optimal strategy involves high commitment to multilateralism and rules-based cooperation</span>, not despite but precisely because of our national interests in security, prosperity, and sovereignty. This essay argues that <span class="highlight-link">Singapore should prioritize international cooperation as the primary means of serving national interests</span>, while maintaining sovereignty over specific vital domains where external constraints would compromise core national welfare.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-relevance">Singapore should prioritize international cooperation because our national interests - economic prosperity, security, and regional stability - are fundamentally dependent on a functioning multilateral system.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">Unlike continental powers with vast territories, populations, and resources who can sustain themselves through domestic markets and military might, Singapore's survival hinges on international trade, open markets, and rules-based order that constrain arbitrary power.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">Singapore's trade-to-GDP ratio exceeds 300%, our port handles over 37 million shipping containers annually, and Changi Airport serves as a global aviation hub - this radical openness means that protectionism, unilateralism, or deglobalization directly threaten our economic model.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">International cooperation through frameworks like the World Trade Organization, ASEAN Economic Community, and bilateral free trade agreements provides the stable, predictable environment that enables this trade-dependent prosperity; absent such multilateral rules, Singapore would be vulnerable to larger neighbors imposing arbitrary terms.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">Similarly, security cooperation through ASEAN, the Five Power Defence Arrangements, and strategic partnerships with major powers creates a regional balance that prevents any single power from dominating Southeast Asia - a scenario that would severely constrain Singapore's autonomy.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">ASEAN's principle of multilateral consultation and consensus-building, despite its limitations, provides small states like Singapore disproportionate influence relative to our size, amplifying our voice on issues from South China Sea disputes to trade negotiations.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, far from conflicting with national interests, international cooperation actively serves Singapore's core objectives of economic prosperity and security, making high commitment to multilateralism a rational national priority rather than altruistic idealism.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="success-note">
                <strong>ANNOTATION: Paragraph Structure</strong>
                <p>This paragraph demonstrates: (1) Topic sentence connecting cooperation to national interests, (2) Conceptual explanation of why small states differ from great powers, (3) Economic examples with evaluation of how trade-dependence necessitates cooperation, (4) Security examples showing ASEAN's strategic value, (5) Link explicitly answering question</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">Moreover, the multipolar context specifically reinforces the imperative for Singapore to prioritize international cooperation over narrow nationalism.</span> In a multipolar world where US hegemony has declined but no single power dominates, <span class="highlight-sophistication">middle powers and small states gain leverage through collective action and institutional frameworks that constrain unilateral behavior by great powers.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">Singapore's strategy of maintaining relationships with all major powers - hosting US military facilities while being China's largest ASEAN trade partner and engaging India and Europe simultaneously - exemplifies how multilateral engagement enables hedging that purely bilateral relations would not afford.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">When great powers pressure smaller states to choose sides, as evident in recent US-China tensions over technology, trade, and security architectures, multilateral forums like ASEAN provide collective platforms for resisting such pressure and asserting preferences for open, inclusive regional order.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">Singapore's consistent championing of ASEAN centrality, international law including UNCLOS for maritime disputes, and rules-based frameworks represents not naive idealism but hard-nosed pragmatism:</span> in a multipolar system, rules constrain the strong more than they burden the weak, making multilateralism a source of security for small states who cannot rely on military power alone. <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, precisely because we inhabit a multipolar world with competing power centers, Singapore should prioritize international cooperation as the mechanism that maximizes our autonomy and influence rather than becoming a pawn in great power competition.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">However, acknowledging that international cooperation serves national interests does not imply uncritical subordination of sovereignty to international demands in all domains.</span> <span class="highlight-relevance">Singapore must retain prioritization of national interests over international cooperation in specific vital areas:</span> domestic political sovereignty, core defense capabilities, and resource security. <span class="highlight-evaluation">Singapore's maintenance of strict domestic political controls, including restrictions on foreign interference in domestic politics and media regulations that liberal international partners critique, reflects the judgment that political stability is a non-negotiable national interest that outweighs international pressure for alignment with Western democratic norms.</span> Similarly, while Singapore engages extensively in defense cooperation, we maintain independent deterrent capabilities including conscription, advanced weaponry, and cybersecurity infrastructure, refusing to fully outsource defense to alliances despite their value. <span class="highlight-evaluation">These reserved domains reflect rational calculation that certain existential requirements - regime stability, military capability, resource access - cannot be entrusted entirely to international goodwill, as cooperation can break down precisely when most needed during crises.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, while international cooperation should be prioritized across most policy domains, protecting national interests requires maintaining sovereign control over these specific vital functions even when international actors prefer otherwise.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="success-note">
                <strong>ANNOTATION: Balanced Treatment</strong>
                <p>This paragraph provides necessary balance - acknowledging areas where national sovereignty must supersede international pressure. Examples: political controls, defense capabilities, resource security. This prevents essay from being one-sided and shows sophisticated understanding that even cooperation-first strategy has limits.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-relevance">In conclusion, the question's framing - "prioritize national interests over international cooperation" - presents a false choice for Singapore.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">The evidence demonstrates that robust international cooperation through multilateral institutions, rules-based frameworks, and collective action is not contrary to but rather constitutive of Singapore's national interests in prosperity, security, and autonomy, especially in a multipolar landscape where small states cannot survive through unilateral power.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">The apparent tension between national interests and international cooperation dissolves when we recognize that Singapore's national interest IS the preservation and strengthening of cooperative international order - open trade, freedom of navigation, rules constraining arbitrary power, multilateral platforms amplifying small state voices.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, Singapore should maintain very high prioritization of international cooperation as the primary instrument of national interest advancement, while protecting core sovereignty in specific domains (domestic politics, defense capabilities, resource security) where cooperation's benefits are outweighed by risks of dependence.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">For a small, trade-dependent, vulnerable city-state, the multipolar world is navigable not through nationalism and insularity but through active, strategic internationalism - making cooperation not a luxury but necessity.</span>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>CHALLENGING QUESTION ASSUMPTIONS</strong>
            <p>This essay demonstrates how to challenge a question's framing rather than accepting it uncritically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Question assumes:</strong> National interests and international cooperation are opposed/zero-sum</li>
                <li><strong>Essay challenges:</strong> "False dichotomy" - for Singapore, cooperation IS national interest</li>
                <li><strong>Why this works:</strong> Provides evidence showing they're interdependent, not competitive (trade-dependence, security through multilateralism)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This sophisticated move - questioning the question - demonstrates critical thinking that elevates to Band 5.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>SINGAPORE CONTEXT IS ESSENTIAL</strong>
            <p>Notice how Singapore's specific characteristics drive every argument:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small size → vulnerable → needs rules to constrain power</li>
                <li>Trade-dependent → needs open system → cooperation essential</li>
                <li>Multipolar strategy → hedging with all powers → multilateralism enables this</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without Singapore-specific analysis, this becomes generic "cooperation is good" essay. The specificity makes it excellent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>TRY THIS: Analyzing "Your Society" Questions</strong>
            <p>For Singapore questions, always:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>List Singapore's defining traits (AAME + pragmatic, small, trade-dependent, etc.)</li>
                <li>Ask: How does EACH trait affect the issue at hand?</li>
                <li>Use traits to generate arguments: "Because Singapore is X, therefore Y"</li>
