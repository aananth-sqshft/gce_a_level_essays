        <h1>Model Answer Analysis: Food Within Singaporean Culture</h1>
        <div class="word-count">Question Type: Value (V) | Singapore-Specific | Topic: Society & Culture</div>

        <!-- SECTION 1: THINKING PROCESS -->
        <h2>SECTION 1: INITIAL THINKING PROCESS & APPROACH</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: First Impressions (Raw Thoughts)</h3>
        <p>
            This is a <span class="highlight-relevance">Value question asking to "assess the importance" of food within Singapore's culture</span>. The word "assess" means I need to evaluate—to weigh arguments on both sides and come to a measured conclusion about how important food is.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What type of question?</strong> Using VIPERCJ, this is primarily a <strong>V (Value)</strong> question. It asks "how important/valuable is food?" But it's also asking for an <strong>I (Impact)</strong> analysis: what impact does food play in Singapore's culture?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the two clear sides?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SIDE A (Food IS very important):</strong> Food is central to Singaporean identity, brings communities together, reflects history, defines us locally and globally</li>
                <li><strong>SIDE B (Food is OVER-emphasized):</strong> Singapore's identity goes beyond food; we risk reducing a complex culture to just hawker stalls; other elements (education, innovation, diversity) matter more</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Extreme/absolute words?</strong> The question asks "Assess the importance"—no absolute words like "always" or "never," so this is a straightforward value assessment, not requiring a synthesis structure.
        </p>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>CRITICAL ANNOTATION FOR YOU:</strong>
            <p>Notice how I am NOT immediately thinking "What examples of Singaporean food do I know?" Instead, I'm thinking: "What is this question actually asking me to debate?" This prevents the common mistake of building the essay around memorized examples rather than around the question's actual requirements. I'm mapping the <em>debate structure first</em>, then examples will come later to support these debate points.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Understanding Keywords</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>"Food within Singaporean culture"</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food:</strong> Not just sustenance, but eating practices, food traditions, hawker culture, dining rituals, fusion cuisines, food heritage</li>
                <li><strong>Singaporean culture:</strong> The distinct cultural identity of Singapore—multiracial, pragmatic, influenced by Malay, Chinese, Indian, British traditions</li>
                <li><strong>Within:</strong> Food as a PART of culture, not all of it (this is important—we're not saying food IS Singaporean culture, but that it exists within it)</li>
                <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Centrality, significance, value, impact on how people live and identify themselves</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3: Conceptual Framing</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>What is this question REALLY asking?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This question is asking: "To what degree is food a defining characteristic of Singaporean identity and culture?" It's asking whether food is central or peripheral to what makes Singapore culturally unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Underlying tensions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Pragmatism vs. tradition: Singapore is pragmatic and forward-looking, yet food represents our traditions and heritage</li>
                <li>Global vs. local: Singapore is globalized and cosmopolitan, yet hawker food is distinctly local</li>
                <li>Tangible vs. intangible: Food is concrete and experiential; culture is abstract—food is a tangible way to experience culture</li>
                <li>Identity vs. homogenization: Food can either strengthen our distinct identity or reduce us to stereotypes (Singapore = hawker stalls)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                <td>Food is <span class="highlight-relevance">very important to Singaporean culture</span>, but not the ONLY defining element. It is important because: (1) It unites different races through shared dining; (2) It reflects our pragmatic values (efficient, affordable, quality); (3) It's a unique global identifier; (4) It embodies our multicultural heritage. However, it's also important not to overstate—education, governance, and innovation are equally important to Singapore's identity.</td>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>HOW ASSUMPTIONS GENERATE ARGUMENTS:</strong>
            <p>By identifying the assumptions, I can build <em>specific arguments</em> rather than recycled points. For instance, if I know the question assumes "importance can be measured," I can generate arguments by asking: "What MEASURES importance? Social impact? Economic value? Identity formation? Historical significance?" Each answer gives me a different argument angle.</p>

If I write one paragraph for each dimension, I automatically have diverse, non-repetitive arguments. Different lenses = different content.</p>

                    <strong>Position 1:</strong> Food is the primary site where Singaporean multiculturalism is lived and experienced daily. Hawker stalls are where racial harmony happens organically through shared meals.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Position 2:</strong> Food is Singapore's global identifier. Internationally, Singapore is recognized for hawker culture and fusion food. This makes food centrally important to our projected identity.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Position 3:</strong> Food embodies Singapore's core values (pragmatism, egalitarianism, efficiency). The hawker system reflects who we are as a society.

                <td>
                    <strong>Position 1:</strong> While food is culturally significant, Singapore's identity is built more fundamentally on education, innovation, governance, and meritocracy. These are the deeper "values," while food is a surface manifestation.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Position 2:</strong> Food's visibility might make it seem more important than it is. We risk reducing complex Singaporean culture to "hawker stalls" when culture includes law, language, education, work ethic, political systems.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Position 3:</strong> Food practices are changing rapidly (food delivery, instant noodles replacing traditional cooking). If food were truly central to identity, cultural loss would be catastrophic—yet Singapore's identity remains stable.

        <h3>Step 6: Topic Sentence Construction</h3>
        <p><strong>Structural Choice: Balanced Scale (2+2)</strong></p>
        <p>I will use the <span class="highlight-relevance">Balanced Scale (2+2) structure</span> because the question presents two genuinely debatable positions: (1) Food IS very important to Singaporean culture, and (2) Food, while significant, is not the PRIMARY defining element. The word "assess" invites me to weigh both perspectives fairly before concluding.</p>

        <h4>Topic Sentences (with subconcept combinations):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Paragraph 1 (Supporting food's importance):</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">"Food culture, particularly hawker dining, is profoundly important to Singaporean identity because it is the primary space where our multiracial society is actively lived and experienced—a shared democratic space where race becomes irrelevant."</span>
                <ul><li>Combines: <strong>Hawker culture</strong> (subconcept of food) + <strong>Multiracial/Multicultural</strong> (AAME feature) + <strong>Social dimension</strong> (SPERMS)</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Paragraph 2 (Supporting food's importance):</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">"The importance of food to Singaporean culture is further evident in how hawker culture globally represents and embodies our pragmatic values, efficiency, and egalitarian ethos—making it a cornerstone of our external and internal cultural identity."</span>
                <ul><li>Combines: <strong>Food identity</strong> (subconcept) + <strong>Pragmatic values</strong> (Singapore feature) + <strong>Economic/Political dimension</strong> (SPERMS)</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Paragraph 3 (Challenging food's centrality):</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">"However, while food is undeniably important, the argument that it is central to Singaporean culture risks conflating visibility with fundamental importance—our identity is equally, if not more, defined by meritocratic systems, educational excellence, and governance structures that shape daily life more profoundly than dining choices."</span>
                <ul><li>Combines: <strong>Meritocratic system</strong> and <strong>Education-focused</strong> (AAME features) + <strong>Political/Moral dimensions</strong> (SPERMS)</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Paragraph 4 (Synthesized conclusion):</strong> <span class="highlight-relevance">"Ultimately, food is best understood as a crucial <em>manifestation</em> rather than a <em>foundation</em> of Singaporean culture—important because it reflects and reinforces our deeper values, but not independent of them. Its true importance lies not in the food itself, but in what the food culture reveals about who we are."</span>
                <ul><li>Synthesizes: Food's importance is <em>real but conditional</em>—important as expression of values, not as a standalone identity marker</li></ul>
            </li>

            <strong>HOW THESE TOPIC SENTENCES ENSURE RELEVANCE:</strong>
            <p>Notice how each topic sentence directly uses the question's keywords ("important," "Singaporean culture," "food") and explicitly answers the question being asked. Each sentence could be deleted from a different question and wouldn't fit—they're SPECIFIC to THIS question's requirements. This is how you maintain relevance: every topic sentence is a mini-answer to the actual question.</p>

        <div class="essay-text">
            <p>
                <span class="highlight-relevance">Food occupies a position of profound importance within Singaporean culture</span>, serving simultaneously as a lived experience of multiculturalism, a global symbol of national identity, and a tangible manifestation of core societal values. However, the true measure of its importance lies not in the food itself, but in what our food culture reveals about who we are as a society—making it deeply significant while remaining ultimately a reflection rather than foundation of Singaporean identity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The paramount importance of food to Singaporean culture becomes most evident when examining hawker culture as <span class="highlight-relevance">the primary physical space where our multiracial society is actively experienced and affirmed daily</span>. Unlike educational institutions or workplaces—where racial or class divisions may subtly persist—the hawker stall operates as a fundamentally egalitarian arena. A billionaire and a construction worker queue for the same chicken rice; a Chinese diner selects Malay roti prata without hesitation; families of mixed descent gather around communal tables without self-consciousness. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This everyday reality is crucial: multiculturalism is not merely a policy or slogan, but is literally consumed and embodied through shared meals. Food becomes the vehicle through which abstract ideals of racial harmony become concrete, lived experience.</span> Other countries can espouse multicultural values; Singapore's food culture proves them through action. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, food is profoundly important to Singapore's culture precisely because it is the most accessible site where our multicultural identity is continuously reinforced.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond its social significance, food is central to Singaporean culture because <span class="highlight-relevance">hawker cuisine embodies and broadcasts our national character internationally</span>. When foreigners encounter Singapore, they experience our culture through hawker stalls before—or instead of—engaging with other cultural institutions. This is not incidental. The Singapore government, recognizing food's cultural importance, has designated hawker stalls as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage and invests substantially in preserving aging hawker centers. This demonstrates official recognition that food is not peripheral but axial to Singaporean identity. <span class="highlight-evaluation">Furthermore, the characteristics of our food culture directly reflect pragmatic, meritocratic values: hawker food is affordable (egalitarian), efficient (pragmatic), and of consistently high quality (merit-based—stalls succeed on skill, not connections). An outsider eating laksa is not merely consuming noodles; they are experiencing pragmatism and egalitarianism made edible.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">In this sense, food transcends mere sustenance and becomes a cipher through which Singapore's defining ethos is transmitted globally.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, food's importance to Singaporean culture extends beyond domestic cohesion to constitute a fundamental element of how we are recognized and understood internationally.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Yet this prominence warrants critical examination. <span class="highlight-relevance">While food is unquestionably important, conflating visibility with foundational significance presents a distorted assessment of what truly defines Singaporean culture.</span> The hawker stall is conspicuous and tangible; education systems, meritocratic structures, and governance frameworks are abstract and less immediately apparent, yet arguably more formative of cultural identity. Consider: hawker food consumption is optional—Singaporeans can embrace delivery apps, instant noodles, or international cuisine. Conversely, the meritocratic system and educational excellence are inescapable structuring forces shaping how Singaporeans think, aspire, and organize society. <span class="highlight-evaluation">A second-generation Singaporean child who has never eaten traditional hawker food is still fundamentally shaped by Singapore's competitive education system, work ethic, and pragmatic values. Food reflects these deeper currents but does not generate them.</span> Furthermore, <span class="highlight-sophistication">rapid changes in food consumption patterns—the rise of food delivery services, the decline of traditional cooking at home, younger generations' preferences for international cuisine—have not precipitated cultural crisis or identity loss, suggesting that food, while culturally significant, is not essential to maintaining Singaporean identity.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, while food contributes importantly to Singaporean culture, it cannot be considered the central defining element when more foundational systems of education, meritocracy, and governance prove more consistently constitutive of what Singapore is.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-relevance">In conclusion, food deserves to be recognized as profoundly important to Singaporean culture, yet more accurately understood as a crucial manifestation of that culture rather than its foundation.</span> Hawker culture is important because it reflects our commitment to multiculturalism, egalitarianism, and pragmatism—but these values would persist even without food culture, whereas food culture cannot exist without these underlying values. <span class="highlight-evaluation">The relationship is analogous to clothing and identity: clothing expresses identity and is culturally meaningful, but is not the source of identity.</span> Food's true importance lies in its capacity to make abstract values tangible, accessible, and continuously renewed through daily practice. <span class="highlight-link">Therefore, food is best assessed as deeply important to Singaporean culture—not as an independent cornerstone, but as an essential and visible expression of the values that genuinely define us.</span>

        <!-- PARAGRAPH ANNOTATIONS -->
        <h2>DETAILED ANNOTATIONS</h2>

        <h3>Introduction Annotation</h3>
        <div class="annotation">
            <strong>What this paragraph does:</strong> The introduction acknowledges the affirmative position (food IS important) while immediately introducing nuance (it's a reflection, not foundation). This signals sophistication—we're not taking an absolute position, but exploring complexity.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Relevance technique:</strong> Notice the introduction directly addresses the question ("Food occupies a position of... importance within Singaporean culture") using question keywords. It's not just introducing the topic of food; it's directly answering "how important is it?"
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why this matters for YOU:</strong> Your self-evaluation indicated you sometimes build around memorized examples. This introduction avoids that by starting with the <em>question</em> not examples. We haven't mentioned a single dish yet—we're first establishing what position we're taking on the question itself.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Sophisticated language:</strong> "Occupies a position of profound importance" is more sophisticated than "Food is important." "Manifestation of core values" is more sophisticated than "shows our values."
        </div>

        <h3>Paragraph 1 Annotation</h3>
        <div class="annotation">
            <strong>Structural analysis:</strong> This paragraph presents the AFFIRMATIVE case: food IS profoundly important because it's where multiculturalism is lived. It moves from general claim → conceptual explanation → specific example (hawker stalls) → evaluation of how this proves the point.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How it maintains relevance:</strong> This paragraph is NOT just "hawker stalls are cool"—it specifically addresses the question about importance. The argument is: "Food is important TO SINGAPOREAN CULTURE BECAUSE [specific mechanism: it's where multiculturalism happens]." Every sentence connects back to the question's requirement to assess IMPORTANCE.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Example selection and evaluation:</strong> The examples (billionaire/worker equality, mixed race families) were chosen specifically because they illustrate the claim about multiculturalism, not because they're memorized food facts. Crucially, after the examples, we EVALUATE: "This everyday reality is crucial: multiculturalism is not merely a policy...but is literally consumed and embodied." This explanation of HOW the examples prove the point is what your marker wants to see.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Structural breakdown:</strong> Topic (1) → Concept (2) → Example (2) → Evaluation (2) → Link (1) = 8 sentences, approximately 200 words. Notice there's no padding; every sentence contributes substance.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Dimension angle:</strong> This paragraph approaches food through the SOCIAL dimension (SPERMS): how food creates social cohesion. Paragraph 2 will approach it from ECONOMIC/POLITICAL angles. Different lenses = no repetition.
        </div>

        <h3>Paragraph 2 Annotation</h3>
        <div class="annotation">
            <strong>What this paragraph does:</strong> It continues the affirmative case, but from a different angle: global identity and values. This prevents repetition—we're not re-arguing the same point, but adding a second pillar of support for why food IS important.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How government involvement strengthens the argument:</strong> By noting that Singapore's government officially recognizes hawker culture as UNESCO heritage and invests in preservation, we're providing evidence that even OFFICIAL sources recognize food's importance. This is evaluation—explaining WHY UNESCO status matters: it indicates consensus that this is culturally significant.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Language sophistication:</strong> "Hawker cuisine embodies and broadcasts our national character" is more sophisticated than "Hawker food shows who we are." "Cipher through which Singapore's defining ethos is transmitted" is more sophisticated than "food shows our values." Notice the progression from simple to sophisticated vocabulary within a single essay.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why the foods are chosen:</strong> Laksa is chosen because it's inherently multicultural—it blends Malay, Chinese, Indian influences. This makes it not just an example of food, but an example of the specific claim being made (multiculturalism expressed through food). The example is chosen to prove the exact point being argued.
        </div>

        <h3>Paragraph 3 Annotation</h3>
        <div class="annotation">
            <strong>Structural role:</strong> This is the NEGATIVE paragraph—the counterargument. It presents a serious challenge to the affirmative position. Notice it doesn't say "Food is unimportant" (which would be weak); it says "Food is important, but not CENTRAL"—a more sophisticated distinction.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Qualifier technique:</strong> "While food is unquestionably important, conflating visibility with significance..." This is a QUALIFIER—we're acknowledging food's importance while introducing nuance. This shows balanced thinking (Band 5 criterion).
            <br><br>
            <strong>Evaluation examples:</strong> The examples (optional food consumption, decline of home cooking) are used to evaluate a point: "If food were truly foundational, cultural loss would be catastrophic—yet identity persists." This is evaluation in action—explaining the mechanism by which the example proves the point.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Different dimension, different lens:</strong> If Paragraph 1 was SOCIAL (community), Paragraph 2 was POLITICAL/ECONOMIC (global identity), then Paragraph 3 is CONCEPTUAL (what makes something "foundational" vs. "reflective"). This ensures all paragraphs explore different aspects.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Link execution:</strong> The paragraph ends: "it cannot be considered the central defining element when more foundational systems...prove more consistently constitutive." This explicitly links back to the question ("important to Singaporean culture") while giving a measured, qualified answer. This is how you pass the LINK TEST.
        </div>

        <h3>Conclusion Annotation</h3>
        <div class="annotation">
            <strong>Synthesis approach:</strong> The conclusion doesn't just repeat both sides; it synthesizes them into a third position: food is "important but reflective." This is synthesis at Band 5 level—not "both sides have merit" but "here's how both sides relate to create a more accurate answer."
            <br><br>
            <strong>Analogy technique:</strong> The clothing analogy is sophisticated—it's a CONCEPTUAL tool that helps readers understand the relationship between food and culture. This shows thinking beyond just "food is important because..."
            <br><br>
            <strong>Final link:</strong> The conclusion ends with the question keywords ("Food is best assessed as...important to Singaporean culture") making the final link explicit. The reader knows exactly how the essay answers the original question.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Measured and nuanced:</strong> The conclusion doesn't overstate or understate. It acknowledges food's genuine significance while refusing to exaggerate its role. This is the "nuanced conclusion" that Band 5 requires.

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>ADDRESSING YOUR MAIN WEAKNESS: Building Around Memorized Examples</strong>
            <p>Your self-evaluation stated: "I build points around memorized examples/essays → marker describes as IRRELEVANT."</p>
            <p><strong>How this essay avoids that trap:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Question-first approach:</strong> The essay did NOT start by thinking "What do I know about Singaporean food?" Instead, it started by analyzing the question structure: "What does 'assess importance' mean? What are the two sides of this debate?" Only after answering these questions were examples selected.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples serve arguments, not vice versa:</strong> The hawker stall example was chosen because it specifically illustrates the claim "multiculturalism is lived through food," not because it's a memorized fact about Singapore. The food delivery example was chosen to argue "food is changeable, therefore not foundational," not because it's current.</li>
                <li><strong>Every example is evaluated:</strong> After each example, the essay explains HOW it proves the point. For instance: "This everyday reality is crucial: multiculturalism is not merely a policy...but is literally consumed and embodied." This evaluation step is what transforms examples from name-dropping into evidence.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Actionable practice:</strong> Before you use ANY example, write the sentence that evaluates it: "This example proves that [claim] because [mechanism]." If you can't complete this sentence, your example doesn't specifically support your point.</p>

            <strong>LEARNING NOTE: Generating Original, Non-Repetitive Points</strong>
            <p><strong>How this essay prevented repetition:</strong> By using the SPERMS framework (Social, Political, Economic, Moral, Science/Tech), each paragraph approached the question from a different dimension:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> SOCIAL angle—how food creates community</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> POLITICAL/ECONOMIC angle—global identity, government recognition</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> CONCEPTUAL angle—what "foundational" means</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because each paragraph uses a different lens, arguments are automatically diverse. If all three paragraphs had used the SOCIAL angle, they would be repetitive. Different lenses = different content.</p>

            <strong>LEARNING NOTE: Word Choice and Reaching Full Length</strong>
            <p><strong>Sophisticated vocabulary used in this essay:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Profound" not "important"</li>
                <li>"Manifested" not "shown"</li>
                <li>"Egalitarian arena" not "fair place"</li>
                <li>"Cipher" not "example" or "symbol"</li>
                <li>"Constitutive of" not "makes up"</li>
                <li>"Inescapable structuring forces" not "things that shape us"</li>
                <li>"Ethos" not "character" or "values"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why they're effective:</strong> "Egalitarian arena" doesn't just mean "fair place"—it uses a technical term that shows understanding of sociological concepts. "Constitutive of" shows understanding of what "culture" means—not just things that happen in a culture, but things that actively construct/create it.</p>
            <p><strong>Reaching full length naturally:</strong> This essay is 720 words, well within the 500-800 range. How? By following the 200-word paragraph formula consistently: each body paragraph includes topic sentence, conceptual explanation, example, evaluation, and link. This structure prevents both skimpiness and padding.</p>

            <strong>SUCCESS NOTE: The Link Test in Action</strong>
            <p><strong>How each paragraph passes the Link Test:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 1 link:</strong> "Thus, food is profoundly important to Singapore's culture precisely because it is the most accessible site where our multicultural identity is continuously reinforced." ✓ Uses question keyword "important," answers with "because" explanation</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 2 link:</strong> "Therefore, food's importance to Singaporean culture extends beyond domestic cohesion to constitute a fundamental element of how we are recognized and understood internationally." ✓ Uses "importance," "Singaporean culture," gives explicit answer</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 3 link:</strong> "Thus, while food contributes importantly to Singaporean culture, it cannot be considered the central defining element..." ✓ Directly addresses the assessment question with qualification</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Practice habit:</strong> Before finishing each paragraph, reread your last sentence and ask: "Does this use question keywords AND explicitly answer the question?" If no, it's not linked.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 6: PRACTICE EXERCISE FOR YOU</h2>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>TRY THIS WITH YOUR NEXT QUESTION:</strong>
            <p>Pick another question from your syllabus. Before writing a single word of the essay, complete this checklist. The discipline here will eliminate relevance issues:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Question type:</strong> What is this question asking? (Use VIPERCJ—Is it V? I? P? E? R? C? J?)</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme/absolute words:</strong> Does it use ALL, NEVER, ALWAYS, ONLY? This signals whether you need synthesis structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Two sides:</strong> What are the TWO GENUINELY DEBATABLE positions? (Don't say "both sides are right"—what's the actual tension?)</li>
                <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Which SPERMS dimensions are relevant? (Social? Political? Economic? Moral? Science?)</li>
                <li><strong>Subconcepts:</strong> For each keyword, what are its subconcepts? (Create your "menu")</li>
                <li><strong>Topic sentences:</strong> Write 4 topic sentences from different angles—one for each dimension you identified. Each should directly address the question.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> NOW (and only now) ask: "What examples specifically illustrate these topic sentences?" Not: "What do I remember about this topic?"</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluations:</strong> For each example, write: "This proves that [claim] because [mechanism]."</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Notice what happened:</strong> Examples came LAST, not first. This guarantees relevance because examples are selected to prove specific arguments, not just mentioned because you remember them.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
            This model answer demonstrates how to assess a "your society" question by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting with question analysis, not example collection</li>
            <li>Using frameworks (AAME, SPERMS) to generate diverse, non-repetitive arguments</li>
            <li>Balancing genuine opposing perspectives</li>
            <li>Evaluating every example to show HOW it proves the specific claim</li>
            <li>Linking every paragraph back to the question using question keywords</li>
            <li>Synthesizing a nuanced conclusion rather than choosing sides</li>
            <li>Using sophisticated vocabulary and varied sentence structures throughout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This approach directly addresses your identified weakness (building around memorized examples) by ensuring that examples are always chosen to serve arguments, not vice versa. With practice of this method, your Band 5 potential becomes achievable.
