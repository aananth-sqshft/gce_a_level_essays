    <h2>Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>Build them up into topic sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Providing free healthcare for all citizens is desirable in <strong>principle</strong> as it <strong>equalises access</strong> and <strong>ensures all citizens are given the opportunity to lead full, fulfilling lives</strong>.</li>
        <li>b. Providing free healthcare for all citizens is desirable in <strong>practice</strong> as it pays off when citizens reciprocate by being more <strong>efficient at work</strong> and <strong>engaged in civic affairs</strong>.</li>
        <li>c. Providing free healthcare for all citizens is not desirable as it may be <strong>less fair</strong>, not more, that the richest benefit comparatively little (because they go to private doctors) while the poorest benefit comparatively much (because they pay the least taxes).</li>
        <li>d. Providing free healthcare for all citizens is not desirable as it may <strong>inadvertently incentive irresponsible behaviour</strong>, leaving citizens <strong>less healthy</strong> when they neglect to manage their own food intakes or fitness regimes.</li>
    </ul>
