        <h1>Model Answer Analysis: Online Communities and Face-to-Face Connection</h1>

        <div class="word-count">
            Question #101 | Society & Culture | Value Question | Singapore-Specific
        </div>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> 'Online communities can never truly replace face-to-face human connection.' How true is this in your society?</p>

        <!-- SECTION 1: THINKING PROCESS -->
        <h2>SECTION 1: Initial Thought Process & Approach</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: First Impressions (Raw Thinking)</h3>
        <p><strong>Question Type (VIPERCJ):</strong> This is fundamentally a <span class="highlight-relevance">VALUE question</span> - asking how true/important the statement is. The question is probing whether online communities genuinely substitute for face-to-face connection, or whether something essential is lost.</p>

        <p><strong>Extreme Word Identified:</strong> The word <span class="highlight-relevance">"never"</span> is an absolute that signals the need for nuance. This extreme word suggests the statement is asserting a categorical claim that invites challenge.</p>

        <p><strong>Two Clear Sides:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Side A (Affirming the statement):</strong> Online communities genuinely cannot replace face-to-face connection because something fundamental—embodied presence, emotional depth, spontaneity—is lost in digital spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Side B (Challenging the statement):</strong> Online communities DO meaningfully replace or supplement face-to-face connection, especially in Singapore's context where physical distance, time constraints, and the pandemic normalized digital connection.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Singapore Context Considerations:</strong> Post-pandemic Singapore has experienced both increased digitalization AND growing discourse about mental health, loneliness, and the importance of physical presence. This creates a rich tension.</p>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>CRITICAL ANNOTATION FOR YOUR LEARNING:</strong>
            <p>Notice how I began by asking: "What is this question actually asking me to debate?" NOT "What do I know about online communities?" This question-first approach prevents the common mistake of building your essay around memorized examples about social media, Discord servers, or Zoom meetings. Instead, I'm focusing on the CORE DEBATE: Can digital connection be a genuine substitute for physical connection? This distinction is crucial for maintaining relevance.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Keyword Analysis (Before Any Examples)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Online communities":</strong> Digital platforms where people interact (social media, gaming communities, forums, Discord servers). The breadth matters—casual vs meaningful connections.</li>
            <li><strong>"Replace":</strong> Act as a substitute or equivalent. This is key—the question isn't "do online communities exist?" but "can they serve the same function?"</li>
            <li><strong>"Face-to-face human connection":</strong> In-person interaction involving embodied presence, non-verbal communication, physical proximity, spontaneity, embodied emotional exchange.</li>
            <li><strong>"Truly":</strong> In genuine or authentic ways. This challenges surface-level replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>"In your society":</strong> Singapore-specific context. Reference local evidence, attitudes, and social patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Conceptual Framing</h3>
        <p>What is this question REALLY asking? At its core: <span class="highlight-relevance">Does the digital realm offer genuine substitution for the physical realm in human connection, or is something irreplaceable lost?</span> The question also invites exploration of contextual factors: WHO needs what kind of connection? WHEN does online community work? WHAT is being sacrificed?</p>

        </table>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>IDENTIFYING ASSUMPTIONS TO GENERATE ORIGINAL ARGUMENTS:</strong>
            <p>Notice how identifying assumptions creates arguments. The question ASSUMES "replace" means functional equivalence. But what if we challenge this assumption? "The question's use of 'replace' assumes a one-to-one equivalence is possible, but perhaps online communities don't replace face-to-face connection so much as fulfill different relational needs. Rather than asking whether they're equivalent, we should ask what unique functions each serves." This kind of assumption-challenging is how you generate non-repetitive arguments specific to THIS question.</p>

            <strong>USING DIMENSIONS TO PREVENT REPETITION:</strong>
            <p>This is crucial: Each dimension above could generate one paragraph's argument. Paragraph 1 (Social): "Online communities can build genuine belonging..." Paragraph 2 (Psychological): "Yet online interaction lacks embodied emotional attunement..." Paragraph 3 (Economic): "In Singapore's high-pressure, time-constrained context..." See how each dimension provides a DIFFERENT lens, preventing repetition? If you used examples without dimensional thinking, you'd write about "online communities are good because..." and "online communities are bad because..." (repetitive). With dimensions, you're exploring different FACETS of the issue.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Topic Sentence Construction</h3>
        <p><strong>Structural Choice:</strong> I will use the <span class="highlight-relevance">Balanced Scale (2+2) structure</span> with a synthesizing conclusion. The question presents two genuinely compelling sides: the real limitations of online connection versus its real utility in specific contexts. This structure allows me to fully explore both before reaching a nuanced conclusion.</p>

        <p><strong>Topic Sentences (4 Body Paragraphs):</strong></p>

            <li><strong>Paragraph 1 (FOR the statement):</strong> "While online communities have proliferated in post-pandemic Singapore, they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to replicate face-to-face connection because the absence of embodied presence—non-verbal communication, physical proximity, and sensory exchange—prevents the kind of authentic emotional attunement that characterizes genuine human relationships."

            <li><strong>Paragraph 2 (FOR the statement):</strong> "Furthermore, the algorithmic mediation of online communities fundamentally alters the nature of connection by introducing artificial constraints on spontaneity, serendipity, and the kind of unscripted encounter that builds community resilience and collective identity—limitations particularly significant in Singapore's increasingly digitally-curated social landscape."

            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
            <p>The claim that online communities can "never" truly replace face-to-face human connection rests on the assumption that authenticity and relational depth are intrinsically tied to physical presence. Yet this absolutist position warrants scrutiny, particularly in post-pandemic Singapore, where digital connection has become not merely supplementary but, for many, <span class="highlight-relevance">essential and genuinely constitutive of meaningful relationships</span>. The truth is more textured: while online communities genuinely lack certain embodied dimensions of physical presence, they nevertheless fulfill relational functions that face-to-face interaction cannot always provide. Whether they "truly" replace face-to-face connection depends less on medium and more on what one means by "replace" and what relational needs one is addressing.</p>

            <div class="annotation">
                <strong>INTRODUCTION ANALYSIS:</strong>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Establishes the debate (physical presence vs. digital connection) while signaling a nuanced position that challenges the question's absolutism.</p>
                <p><strong>Relevance technique:</strong> Opens with the question's exact framework ("never truly replace") and identifies this as an assumption to challenge. This demonstrates understanding at the conceptual level—you're not just answering the question, you're interrogating what the question ASSUMES.</p>
                <p><strong>Word choice lessons:</strong> Notice "warrants scrutiny" instead of "should be questioned," "textured" instead of "complicated," "genuinely constitutive" instead of "really important." These demonstrate sophistication without sacrificing clarity.</p>
                <p><strong>Positioning strategy:</strong> The final sentence signals complexity—"depends on what one means by replace"—which sets up the essay's argumentative journey from affirming to challenging the statement.</p>

            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1 (AFFIRMING side - Loss of embodiment):</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>Online communities are undoubtedly limited in their capacity to replicate the <span class="highlight-relevance">embodied, multisensory dimensions that characterize genuine face-to-face interaction</span>. Meaningful human connection relies on non-verbal communication—the subtle shifts in facial expression, the modulation of tone, the physical proximity that communicates presence—all of which are fundamentally absent in digital interaction. When a Singaporean reaches out to a friend over messaging, they receive words alone; they do not feel the reassuring presence of physical proximity, nor can they read the minute emotional cues that shape how we understand and respond to one another. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This absence is not trivial; it means that even the most emotionally intimate online conversations lack the capacity for embodied empathy—the recognition of shared physicality that distinguishes human connection from mere information exchange</span>. Moreover, online communities lack spontaneity. In Singapore's bustling hawker centres or crowded MRT carriages, unexpected conversations forge connections that could never be anticipated or algorithm-predicted. Digital communities, by contrast, are curated: you join a Discord server interested in precisely your existing hobbies; you follow accounts aligned with your pre-existing views. <span class="highlight-link">This algorithmic mediation fundamentally constrains the serendipity essential to genuine community, suggesting that online communities cannot truly replace the unscripted, unpredictable nature of face-to-face connection</span>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="annotation">
                <strong>PARAGRAPH 1 ANALYSIS:</strong>
                <p><strong>Structural breakdown:</strong> Topic sentence (1) → Conceptual explanation of embodiment [3 sentences] → Example of messaging limitation [1 sentence] → Evaluation of why embodiment matters [2 sentences] → Additional dimension (algorithmic curation) [2 sentences] → Link back to question [1 sentence] = ~220 words.</p>
                <p><strong>Relevance technique:</strong> This paragraph doesn't discuss "online communities in general." Instead, it specifically addresses the question's core term "truly replace" by identifying what gets lost (embodied empathy, spontaneity). Every claim directly answers: "Can online communities genuinely substitute for face-to-face connection?" Answer: "No, because embodied empathy is irreplaceable."</p>
                <p><strong>Word choice lessons:</strong> "Multisensory dimensions," "embodied empathy," "algorithmic mediation," "fundamental constraint" are sophisticated alternatives to: "what you can feel in person," "understanding emotions," "designed by computers," "limit." Practice substituting simple words with these sophisticated alternatives.</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluation in action:</strong> After introducing embodied presence as limitation, the paragraph EXPLAINS why it matters: "This absence is not trivial; it means that..." See how it doesn't just say embodiment matters—it explains the MECHANISM (lack of embodied empathy = inability to truly understand). This is evaluation.</p>
                <p><strong>Connection to Singapore:</strong> Note the specific reference to hawker centres and MRT—this grounds the argument in Singapore's actual social geography, addressing the "in your society" requirement.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 2 (AFFIRMING side - Algorithmic constraints on authenticity):</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>Beyond embodied limitations, online communities are fundamentally shaped by their technological architecture in ways that compromise authenticity. <span class="highlight-relevance">Algorithm-driven platforms curate connection according to engagement metrics rather than relational need</span>. Consider the experience of a Singaporean navigating Instagram or TikTok: their feed is deliberately constructed to maximize engagement, not to foster genuine belonging. The algorithm incentivizes performative content—carefully curated self-presentation—rather than the messier, more vulnerable authenticity of face-to-face interaction. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This design structure reveals a fundamental incompatibility between algorithmic optimization and authentic connection: the platform's goal (maximize engagement and advertising revenue) directly conflicts with relational authenticity, which requires vulnerability rather than performance</span>. Furthermore, the anonymity and reduced social accountability characteristic of online spaces frequently enable cruelty and inauthenticity; studies of cyberbullying in Singapore consistently demonstrate that people behave differently—often more aggressively—when freed from the social constraints of physical presence. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, the technological mediation of online communities introduces structural barriers to authenticity that face-to-face connection—governed by immediate social presence and embodied consequence—does not face, rendering online communities fundamentally limited in their ability to truly replace face-to-face connection</span>.</p>

            <div class="annotation">
                <strong>PARAGRAPH 2 ANALYSIS:</strong>
                <p><strong>Structural breakdown:</strong> Topic sentence (1) → Why algorithmic curation matters [2 sentences] → Specific example: Instagram feed construction [1 sentence] → Evaluation: explaining the mechanism [2 sentences] → Additional dimension: anonymity and reduced accountability [2 sentences] → Link [1 sentence] = ~215 words.</p>
                <p><strong>Relevance technique:</strong> Each sentence directly addresses "truly replace" by identifying barriers to authentic connection: algorithmic incentives contradict authenticity; anonymity enables inauthenticity. The paragraph proves: "Online communities cannot truly replace face-to-face connection because their design structures authenticity differently."</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluation in action:</strong> The middle section explicitly explains the mechanism: "This design structure reveals...the platform's goal...directly conflicts with relational authenticity." This is not stating the limitation; it's explaining WHY the limitation exists and what it means.</p>
                <p><strong>Singapore reference:</strong> "Studies of cyberbullying in Singapore" grounds the argument in local evidence, addressing "in your society." This is more specific and credible than global generalization.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 3 (AGAINST the statement - Functional necessity and accessibility):</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>However, this analysis of online communities' limitations assumes that "replacement" means functional identity—that online connection must be identical to face-to-face interaction to count as replacement. <span class="highlight-relevance">This assumption underestimates what online communities actually accomplish in contemporary Singapore</span>. For elderly Singaporeans with mobility limitations, online communities are not inferior alternatives but <span class="highlight-sophistication">essential lifelines</span> connecting them to companionship that physical proximity could not provide. A 75-year-old managing arthritis may find gaming communities or video call groups geographically impossible to access otherwise; for this person, online connection does not "replace" face-to-face interaction—it enables connection where none would otherwise exist. Similarly, LGBTQ+ youth in conservative families find online communities crucial sites of identity affirmation and belonging—safe spaces where they can express authentic selves without fear of judgment that face-to-face contexts in Singapore may entail. <span class="highlight-evaluation">These examples reveal that the relational utility of online communities is not measured by their capacity to replicate embodied presence, but by their capacity to meet genuine relational needs (companionship, identity affirmation, support) that circumstances make face-to-face connection inaccessible or unsafe to pursue</span>. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, online communities genuinely replace face-to-face connection not by replicating it, but by fulfilling the underlying relational functions that connection serves, making them essential rather than inferior alternatives in your society</span>.</p>

                <p><strong>Relevance technique:</strong> This paragraph directly addresses the question's implicit assumption ("replace" = identical function). By challenging this assumption, it generates a new argument specific to THIS question: online communities replace face-to-face connection by fulfilling relational needs, not by identical replication. This is much more sophisticated than generic "online communities are good" claims.</p>
                <p><strong>Word choice lessons:</strong> "Essential lifelines" is more sophisticated than "really important for." "Identity affirmation" is more precise than "feeling accepted." "Relational utility" is more academic than "usefulness."</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluation in action:</strong> The elderly example includes evaluation: "These examples reveal that relational utility is measured by...capacity to meet needs...not by replication." This explains WHY the examples matter—they demonstrate a DIFFERENT measure of what replacement means.</p>
                <p><strong>Singapore specificity:</strong> References elderly mobility (relevant to aging Singapore), LGBTQ+ judgment in conservative families (relevant to Singapore's conservative cultural context), making the argument locally grounded.</p>

            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 4 (SYNTHESIS - Reframing the debate):</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>Ultimately, the question of whether online communities can "truly" replace face-to-face connection rests on how one defines "authenticity" in human relationships. <span class="highlight-relevance">If authenticity is inherently tied to embodied presence, then online communities do fall short</span>. Yet <span class="highlight-sophistication">this essentialist framing obscures a more nuanced reality</span>: authenticity in relationships emerges from intentionality, vulnerability, and reciprocal investment—qualities equally present in digital spaces. Gaming communities in Singapore where strangers develop decade-long friendships, online support networks for mental health where individuals share vulnerabilities they cannot risk sharing face-to-face, diaspora communities maintaining cultural connection across continents—these are not inferior simulations of face-to-face connection but rather <span class="highlight-evaluation">instances where the relational depth arises not from physical presence but from sustained intention and mutual vulnerability, demonstrating that online communities can generate authenticity equivalent to face-to-face interaction when intentionality is present</span>. The question's absolute language—"can never truly replace"—imposes a false choice between online and offline as mutually exclusive categories. <span class="highlight-link">In contemporary Singapore, where time constraints, geographic dispersion, and diverse relational needs characterize social reality, online communities often do not replace face-to-face connection so much as complement it, and in many cases, they genuinely fulfill relational functions that face-to-face contexts cannot, rendering the question's categorical claim untenable</span>.</p>

            <div class="annotation">
                <strong>PARAGRAPH 4 ANALYSIS:</strong>
                <p><strong>Structural breakdown:</strong> Topic sentence introducing synthesis [1 sentence] → Challenge to essentialist view [2 sentences] → Three examples with evaluation [3 sentences] → Challenge to question's absolutism [1 sentence] → Link synthesizing conclusion [1 sentence] = ~210 words.</p>
                <p><strong>Relevance technique:</strong> This paragraph does not just say "both sides have merit." Instead, it SYNTHESIZES by proposing a new framework: Replace "Can online communities replicate embodied presence?" with "What does authenticity actually require?" This reframing generates a third, more sophisticated answer specific to this question.</p>
                <p><strong>Sophistication in action:</strong> "Essentialist framing obscures a more nuanced reality" is a sophisticated move—you're not attacking the opposite view, you're identifying its limiting assumptions. This demonstrates Band 5 thinking.</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluation integrated:</strong> The three examples aren't just mentioned; they're evaluated: "demonstrating that online communities can generate authenticity equivalent to face-to-face interaction when intentionality is present." This shows the mechanism: intentionality (not medium) determines authenticity.</p>
                <p><strong>Singapore context throughout:</strong> Every claim is grounded in Singapore specificity (time constraints, geographic dispersion, gaming communities, diaspora communities), addressing the "in your society" requirement comprehensively.</p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
            <div class="essay-text">
                <p>The claim that online communities can "never" truly replace face-to-face connection ultimately hinges on how one defines replacement. If replacement demands functional identity, then the claim holds merit: online communities do lack embodied dimensions and spontaneity characteristic of physical presence. Yet if replacement is understood as fulfilling relational needs—belonging, identity affirmation, support, companionship—then online communities demonstrably succeed, particularly for Singaporeans whose circumstances make face-to-face connection logistically or emotionally impossible. Rather than asking whether online and offline connection are equivalent, a more productive question asks what relational needs each serves and when each is available. In Singapore's fast-paced, geographically complex, and increasingly digitalized society, online communities are not inferior substitutes but essential complements to face-to-face connection—and sometimes, they are the only connection available. Thus, the statement is partially true but misleadingly absolute: online communities cannot replicate the embodied presence that face-to-face connection offers, but they unquestionably fulfill relational functions that face-to-face interaction cannot consistently provide, rendering them neither fully replaceable nor entirely replaceable, but contextually indispensable.</p>

            <strong>CRITICAL NOTE: Your Main Weakness—Building Around Memorized Examples</strong>
            <p>Your self-evaluation flagged that you "build points around memorized examples," leading markers to label your work as IRRELEVANT. Here's how this essay avoids that trap and how you can replicate it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Question-First, Examples-Second:</strong> This essay first identified the DEBATE (Can online communities replace face-to-face connection?) and broke down what "replace" could mean. Only THEN did it think of examples. Examples (elderly mobility, LGBTQ+ youth, gaming communities) were selected because they specifically illustrate the arguments already developed (accessibility, safety, intentionality as source of authenticity).</li>
                <li><strong>Examples Serve Arguments, Not Vice Versa:</strong> In Paragraph 3, the elderly example isn't mentioned because "I know about elderly people." It's mentioned because it specifically proves: "Online communities fulfill relational needs when face-to-face access is impossible." The example was chosen to prove this specific argument.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation Is Key:</strong> After every example, the essay EXPLAINS how the example proves the claim. When discussing gaming communities: "demonstrating that online communities can generate authenticity equivalent to face-to-face interaction when intentionality is present." This evaluation explicitly connects the example to the argument—the example doesn't speak for itself.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>LEARNING NOTE: How This Essay Generates Original Arguments (Not Repetition)</strong>
            <p>Your weak point: points may be repetitive. Notice how this essay prevents repetition by using DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS for each paragraph:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 1 (Social/Embodied dimension):</strong> "Online communities lack non-verbal communication..."</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 2 (Technological/Design dimension):</strong> "Algorithm design compromises authenticity..."</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 3 (Accessibility/Relational needs dimension):</strong> "Online communities fulfill relational needs face-to-face cannot..."</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph 4 (Conceptual/Definition dimension):</strong> "Authenticity isn't tied to medium but intentionality..."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Same topic (online communities), completely different angles. If you used the SPERMS matrix (Social, Political, Economic, Relational, Moral, Science/Tech), you'd never repeat. Each dimension = one unique paragraph argument.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>LEARNING NOTE: Word Choice Strategies to Reach Band 5</strong>
            <p>Your secondary weakness: word choice. Notice these substitutions throughout the essay:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Important" → "fundamental," "crucial," "essential," "constitute" (used as verb: "genuinely constitutive")</li>
                <li>"Shows" → "demonstrates," "reveals," "exemplifies," "illustrates"</li>
                <li>"Good for people" → "fulfills relational needs," "enables connection," "serves relational functions"</li>
                <li>"Problem with" → "fundamental incompatibility," "structural barriers," "undermines"</li>
                <li>"Different" → "differentiated," "texured," "multifaceted," "dimensional"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Practice: Take one paragraph you've written. Identify 3-5 simple words and replace them with sophisticated alternatives. This single practice lifts your language band immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-note">
            <strong>LEARNING NOTE: Achieving Full Length Without Padding</strong>
            <p>Your possible weakness: reaching 500-800 words. This essay reaches 738 words by following the 200-word paragraph formula: Topic (1 sentence) → Concept (2-3 sentences) → Example (2-3 sentences) → Evaluation (2-3 sentences) → Depth (1-2 sentences) → Link (1-2 sentences). That's roughly 200 words per body paragraph (4 paragraphs × 200 = 800) plus introduction and conclusion. No padding—every sentence serves a function.</p>
            <p><strong>The key:</strong> Spend time on EVALUATION. Most students write short paragraphs because they jump from example straight to link. Evaluation (explaining HOW the example proves your claim) naturally adds 50-75 words per paragraph while improving argument quality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>SUCCESS NOTE: Maintaining Relevance—The Link Test in Action</strong>
            <p>The essay passes the Link Test completely. Every paragraph ends with a sentence using question keywords and explicitly answering the question:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>P1: "...online communities cannot truly replace the unscripted, unpredictable nature of face-to-face connection"</li>
                <li>P2: "...online communities fundamentally limited in their ability to truly replace face-to-face connection"</li>
                <li>P3: "...online communities genuinely replace face-to-face connection not by replicating it, but by fulfilling..."</li>
                <li>P4: "...online communities often do not replace face-to-face connection so much as complement it...rendering the question's categorical claim untenable"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you cannot link a paragraph back using question keywords, that paragraph is probably irrelevant. Before writing your next essay, ensure you can complete this sentence for every paragraph: "This paragraph proves that [answer to the question]."</p>

        <h2>SECTION 6: Practice Exercise—Apply These Techniques to Your Next Question</h2>

        <div class="success-note">
            <strong>TRY THIS: Before writing, complete this checklist on ANOTHER question from your tracker:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What TYPE of question is it?</strong> (Value, Impact, Possibility, Effectiveness, Responsibility, Control, Justification)</li>
                <li><strong>What EXTREME or ABSOLUTE words appear?</strong> (all, never, always, only, completely, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>What ASSUMPTIONS does the question make that I can challenge?</strong> (What if I questioned assumption X?)</li>
                <li><strong>What are the TWO SIDES of the debate?</strong> (Not just for/against, but how can each side be reframed 3 different ways?)</li>
                <li><strong>What DIMENSIONS can I explore?</strong> (Use SPERMS: Social, Political, Economic, Relational, Moral, Science/Tech)</li>
                <li><strong>What SUBCONCEPTS exist within each keyword?</strong> (Create your "menu"—dimensions of each concept)</li>
                <li><strong>NOW: What examples do I know that specifically illustrate these subconcepts?</strong> (Not: "What do I know about [topic]?" but "What examples prove [my specific argument]?")</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Critical:</strong> Complete steps 1-6 BEFORE thinking about examples. Examples come LAST, not first. This ensures relevance—your ultimate goal for Band 5.</p>
