        <h1>Model Answer Analysis: Question #105</h1>

        <div class="word-count">
            Question: How effectively does your society prepare young people for the uncertainties of the modern world?
        </div>

        <h2>SECTION 1: Initial Thought Process & Approach</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: First Impressions (Raw Thoughts)</h3>

        <p><strong>What type of question is this? (VIPERCJ)</strong></p>
        <p>This is an <strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong> question - it asks me to assess how well Singapore's systems, institutions, and culture prepare young people for uncertainty. "How effectively" requires me to evaluate success in achieving the goal of preparing youth for an unpredictable future.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the extreme/absolute words?</strong></p>
        <p>No extreme words like "always" or "never." The word <strong>"effectively"</strong> is a scalar judgment - I need to assess the degree of effectiveness on a spectrum from highly effective to ineffective, rather than making a binary judgment.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the two clear sides of the debate?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Side A (Effective):</strong> Singapore's education system develops critical skills (problem-solving, adaptability), strong economic foundation provides security, meritocratic culture encourages resilience, digital infrastructure enables access to opportunities</li>
            <li><strong>Side B (Ineffective):</strong> Education system too rigid/narrow, focus on grades over adaptability, risk-averse culture discourages experimentation, young people lack practical life skills, mental health crisis shows psychological unpreparedness, dependence on government creates passivity</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What is my gut feeling about the answer?</strong></p>
        <p>Singapore is moderately effective but with significant gaps. Strong in technical/academic preparation and economic stability, weak in psychological resilience, creative adaptability, and tolerance for failure. The system prepares youth for a predictable path to success but not for navigating genuine uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>CRITICAL NOTE: Question-First, Examples-Second Principle</strong>
            <p>Notice how I am NOT immediately thinking "What do I know about Singapore's education system?" Instead, I am asking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What does it mean to be 'prepared for uncertainties'?" → What capabilities, skills, and mindsets are required?</li>
                <li>"What are the 'uncertainties of the modern world'?" → Economic disruption, technological change, climate crisis, geopolitical instability, career unpredictability</li>
                <li>"How do we measure 'effectiveness'?" → By outcomes (youth unemployment, mental health, adaptability metrics) or by inputs (education quality, support systems)?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This prevents building the essay around memorized facts about Singapore ("I know about our education system, so I'll write about that") rather than around answering what the question actually asks: <strong>How well does preparation match the requirements of navigating uncertainty?</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Understanding Keywords (Before Any Examples)</h3>

        <p><strong>"Effectively"</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Literal meaning:</strong> Producing the desired result, achieving the stated goal</li>
            <li><strong>Key implication:</strong> I must define what "successful preparation" looks like before I can assess whether it's happening</li>
            <li><strong>Measurement challenges:</strong> Effectiveness could be measured by immediate metrics (employment rates) or long-term outcomes (adaptability over career, mental health)</li>
            <li><strong>What makes this debatable:</strong> Different stakeholders define "effective" differently - government may measure economic productivity, while individuals may value well-being and fulfillment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>"Prepare"</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Literal meaning:</strong> To make ready, to equip with necessary skills, knowledge, mindsets, and resources</li>
            <li><strong>Forms of preparation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Academic/technical skills (knowledge base, qualifications)</li>
                    <li>Soft skills (communication, collaboration, critical thinking)</li>
                    <li>Psychological preparation (resilience, adaptability, coping mechanisms)</li>
                    <li>Practical resources (financial security, social networks, opportunities)</li>
                    <li>Mindsets and values (growth mindset, tolerance for ambiguity, courage to take risks)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Who prepares?</strong> Education system, families, government policies, culture, media, community institutions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>"Young people"</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age range:</strong> Roughly 15-30 years old in Singapore context - secondary school through university and early career</li>
            <li><strong>Life stage:</strong> Transitioning from dependence to independence, making crucial education and career decisions</li>
            <li><strong>Generational context:</strong> Gen Z and younger Millennials who face different uncertainties than previous generations (gig economy, AI disruption, climate change)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>"Uncertainties of the modern world"</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Economic uncertainties:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Job automation and AI replacing traditional careers</li>
                    <li>Gig economy replacing stable employment</li>
                    <li>Multiple career changes expected over lifetime</li>
                    <li>Economic volatility (pandemics, recessions, global supply chain disruptions)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technological uncertainties:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rapid pace of change making skills obsolete quickly</li>
                    <li>Need for continuous learning and reskilling</li>
                    <li>Digital disruption of traditional industries</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Social/political uncertainties:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Geopolitical tensions affecting trade and opportunities</li>
                    <li>Social fragmentation and polarization</li>
                    <li>Changing social norms and values</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Environmental uncertainties:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Climate change impacts on livelihoods and migration</li>
                    <li>Resource scarcity</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Personal uncertainties:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mental health challenges</li>
                    <li>Work-life balance in demanding economy</li>
                    <li>Rising cost of living affecting life plans</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>"Your society" (Singapore)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key characteristics (AAME):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asian Conservative:</strong> Emphasis on family support, respect for authority, collective responsibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Ageing:</strong> Demographic pressures creating economic uncertainties for young</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiracial:</strong> Diverse perspectives but also need for social cohesion</li>
                    <li><strong>Meritocratic:</strong> Achievement-focused culture, high educational standards</li>
                    <li><strong>Education-focused:</strong> Heavy investment in schooling, skills training</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Additional traits:</strong> Pragmatic, paternalistic governance, small nation with limited resources, dependent on global economy, technologically advanced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Conceptual Framing</h3>

        <p><strong>What is this question REALLY asking me to debate?</strong></p>
        <p>At its core, this question asks: <strong>Is Singapore's model of preparing youth - which emphasizes academic excellence, economic productivity, and structured pathways - adequate for a world that increasingly values adaptability, creativity, resilience, and tolerance for ambiguity?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The fundamental tension:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Certainty-oriented preparation:</strong> Singapore has historically prepared youth for predictable success - study hard → good grades → good university → good job → good life. This worked when pathways were stable.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncertainty-oriented preparation:</strong> The modern world requires navigating the unknown - career pivots, rapid technological change, economic disruption, undefined problems. This requires different skills (adaptability, resilience, creativity, risk tolerance).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What are the underlying tensions/conflicts?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Academic excellence vs. Practical resilience:</strong> Does focus on grades come at the expense of developing coping skills, emotional intelligence, and adaptability?</li>
            <li><strong>Risk aversion vs. Innovation:</strong> Does Singapore's emphasis on security and stability create young people who avoid necessary risks?</li>
            <li><strong>Collective support vs. Individual agency:</strong> Does strong government support (subsidies, programs, safety nets) create dependency rather than self-reliance?</li>
            <li><strong>Technical skills vs. Human skills:</strong> Are we preparing workers for jobs that might be automated, while neglecting uniquely human capabilities?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What broader principles are at stake?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose of education: preparation for known paths vs. cultivation of adaptive capacity</li>
            <li>The role of government: providing security vs. enabling independence</li>
            <li>Cultural values: stability and achievement vs. experimentation and growth through failure</li>
        </ul>

                <li><strong>Argument generated:</strong> "However, every generation has faced uncertainty - wars, economic depressions, technological disruptions.

        <h3>Step 5: Topic Sentence Construction & Structural Choice</h3>

        <h4>A. Structural Choice</h4>
        <p><strong>I will use the "Balanced Scale (2+2)" structure.</strong> The question asks for an evaluation ("how effectively"), which requires presenting both strengths and weaknesses before making an overall judgment. I will present 2 paragraphs on Singapore's effectiveness, followed by 2 paragraphs on significant gaps, before concluding with a nuanced assessment that we are moderately effective but with critical shortcomings in psychological and cultural preparation.</p>

        <h4>B. Topic Sentence Construction</h4>

            <li>
                <strong>Paragraph 1 (Effective - Education Foundation):</strong><br>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">Singapore effectively prepares young people for modern uncertainties through its world-class education system, which cultivates robust analytical and technical capabilities that enable adaptive problem-solving in unpredictable contexts.</span>
                <p class="annotation">Combines: "education-focused trait" + "technical skills preparation" + "problem-solving for uncertainty"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Paragraph 2 (Effective - Economic & Institutional Support):</strong><br>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">Furthermore, Singapore's strong economic foundation and comprehensive institutional support - from SkillsFuture reskilling initiatives to National Service leadership training - equip youth with practical resources and opportunities to navigate career transitions and economic volatility.</span>
                <p class="annotation">Combines: "economic dimension" + "government programs" + "pragmatic preparation" + "career adaptability"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Paragraph 3 (Ineffective - Psychological Gaps):</strong><br>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">However, Singapore's preparation falls critically short in cultivating psychological resilience, as evidenced by rising youth mental health crises that reveal young people's struggles to cope with academic pressure, fear of failure, and the emotional demands of navigating uncertainty.</span>
                <p class="annotation">Uses "However" to signal shift. Combines: "psychological dimension" + "mental health outcomes" + "resilience deficits" + "fear of failure"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Paragraph 4 (Ineffective - Cultural Constraints):</strong><br>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">Moreover, Singapore's risk-averse culture and narrow definitions of success through academic achievement and stable careers paradoxically undermine the very adaptability and tolerance for ambiguity that modern uncertainties demand.</span>
                <p class="annotation">Combines: "cultural dimension" + "kiasu/risk aversion" + "meritocracy constraints" + "adaptability requirements"</p>

        </ol>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>RELEVANCE STRATEGY IN TOPIC SENTENCES</strong>
            <p>Notice how each topic sentence directly addresses "prepare young people for uncertainties" using the question's keywords. I'm not just discussing "Singapore's education" generally - every sentence explicitly connects to the specific debate about uncertainty preparation.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of "Singapore has a good education system," I say "Singapore effectively prepares young people for modern uncertainties through its education system, which cultivates capabilities that enable adaptive problem-solving <u>in unpredictable contexts</u>."</p>
            <p>The italicized phrase ensures I'm answering the specific question about uncertainty, not just the general topic of education.</p>

The evaluation explicitly connects: "ability to deconstruct novel problems...becomes essential when career paths are undefined."</p>
                <p><strong>Sophisticated evaluation:</strong> Notice the sentence: "A Singaporean graduate's capacity to master complex technical concepts...represents genuine preparation for a world where the specific knowledge learned today may be obsolete tomorrow, but the capacity to learn endures." This shows deep thinking about what "preparation for uncertainty" actually means - not static knowledge but meta-learning ability.</p>
                <p><strong>200-word structure:</strong> Topic (1) → Conceptual explanation of why analytical skills matter (2) → PISA example (1) → Evaluation connecting to uncertainty (2-3) → Additional depth on STEM/digital (1) → Link (1)</p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">Furthermore, Singapore's strong economic foundation and comprehensive institutional support - from SkillsFuture reskilling initiatives to National Service leadership training - equip youth with practical resources and opportunities to navigate career transitions and economic volatility.</span> The SkillsFuture program exemplifies pragmatic preparation: by providing subsidies for continuous learning and skills upgrading, it institutionalizes the expectation that workers will need to reskill multiple times across their careers, directly addressing the reality of rapid technological change. National Service, meanwhile, develops leadership capabilities, discipline, and resilience through challenging experiences that forge character under pressure. <span class="highlight-evaluation">These programs represent a societal commitment to supporting youth adaptation - not merely preparing them for a single career, but providing ongoing resources to pivot as circumstances change.</span> Additionally, Singapore's low youth unemployment rate (around 6-7% even during COVID-19) and robust job market create favorable conditions for experimentation; young people can take calculated career risks knowing opportunities exist if initial paths fail. <span class="highlight-link">Thus, Singapore's pragmatic approach to institutional support and economic stability effectively provides young people with the material resources and opportunities needed to navigate uncertainty.</span>

            <div class="learning-note">
                <strong>PARAGRAPH 2 ANALYSIS: Effective Argument (Economic/Institutional)</strong>
                <p><strong>Singapore-specific examples:</strong> SkillsFuture and National Service are concrete, local programs - not generic mentions of "education" or "government support." This specificity demonstrates knowledge of your society.</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluation of HOW examples work:</strong> "by providing subsidies for continuous learning and skills upgrading, it institutionalizes the expectation that workers will need to reskill" - explains the MECHANISM by which SkillsFuture prepares for uncertainty.</p>
                <p><strong>Different dimension from P1:</strong> Paragraph 1 was about EDUCATION (cognitive skills). Paragraph 2 is about ECONOMIC/INSTITUTIONAL support (resources and programs). Different lenses = no repetition.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">However, while these institutional strengths provide important preparation, Singapore falls critically short in cultivating psychological resilience, as evidenced by rising youth mental health crises that reveal our young people's struggles to cope with academic pressure, fear of failure, and the emotional demands of navigating uncertainty.</span> <span class="highlight-relevance">The Institute of Mental Health reports that one in seven youth in Singapore has experienced a mental health condition, with anxiety and depression rates climbing particularly sharply among students facing academic and career pressures.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">This mental health crisis is not merely a separate social problem but a direct indicator of failed preparation for uncertainty: if young people cannot psychologically cope with the stress of examinations and defined pathways, how can they be expected to navigate the far greater ambiguities of career disruption, economic instability, and undefined futures?</span> The phenomenon of "failure-to-launch" young adults - those who achieve academic success but struggle with independent decision-making and real-world challenges - further illustrates this gap. <span class="highlight-evaluation">Our education system has optimized for producing high-achieving test-takers while neglecting the emotional intelligence, coping mechanisms, stress management, and self-compassion that enable individuals to persevere through setbacks and maintain wellbeing amid unpredictability.</span> <span class="highlight-link">In this critical dimension, Singapore has been profoundly ineffective at preparing young people for the psychological demands of modern uncertainties.</span>

                <strong>PARAGRAPH 3 ANALYSIS: Ineffective Argument (Psychological Gaps)</strong>
                <p><strong>Transition technique:</strong> "However, while these institutional strengths provide important preparation..." - acknowledges what came before while signaling the shift to critique. This is sophisticated balance.</p>
                <p><strong>Powerful evaluation:</strong> "This mental health crisis is not merely a separate social problem but a direct indicator of failed preparation for uncertainty" - reframes mental health as evidence about the question's core issue (preparation effectiveness), not a tangent.</p>
                <p><strong>Concrete evidence:</strong> "Institute of Mental Health" and "one in seven youth" - specific data strengthens the argument beyond vague claims.</p>
                <p><strong>Link back:</strong> Final sentence uses "preparing young people" and "modern uncertainties" - maintains constant relevance to question.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">Moreover, Singapore's risk-averse culture and narrow definitions of success through academic achievement and stable careers paradoxically undermine the very adaptability and tolerance for ambiguity that modern uncertainties demand.</span> The pervasive "kiasu" mentality - the fear of losing out - manifests in young people's reluctance to deviate from conventional pathways: law, medicine, engineering, business. <span class="highlight-evaluation">This cultural preference for certainty and prestige over exploration and experimentation creates a generation technically capable but psychologically constrained, able to execute defined tasks excellently but uncomfortable with the open-ended problem-solving and entrepreneurial risk-taking that uncertainty requires.</span> When the Institute of Policy Studies surveyed young Singaporeans, only 16% expressed willingness to start their own business, compared to global averages above 30%, revealing risk aversion that ill-suits an unpredictable future where traditional employment structures are eroding. <span class="highlight-evaluation">The irony is profound: our meritocratic emphasis on achievement has made failure terrifying rather than instructive, when modern uncertainty requires precisely the opposite - treating setbacks as learning opportunities and embracing experimentation.</span> <span class="highlight-link">Thus, Singapore's cultural values actively undermine effective preparation for uncertainties, cultivating young people who seek certainty in an age that offers none.</span>

            <div class="learning-note">
                <strong>PARAGRAPH 4 ANALYSIS: Ineffective Argument (Cultural Constraints)</strong>
                <p><strong>Singapore-specific culture:</strong> "Kiasu mentality" is uniquely Singaporean - shows deep understanding of local context beyond generic points about "education systems."</p>
                <p><strong>Sophisticated paradox:</strong> "paradoxically undermine the very adaptability..." and "The irony is profound..." - showing how Singapore's strengths (meritocracy, achievement focus) create weaknesses (fear of failure, risk aversion). This is nuanced, Band 5-level analysis.</p>
                <p><strong>Specific data:</strong> "Institute of Policy Studies" and "16% vs 30%" - concrete evidence rather than assertions.</p>
                <p><strong>Different from P3:</strong> Paragraph 3 was about PSYCHOLOGICAL outcomes (mental health crisis). Paragraph 4 is about CULTURAL VALUES (risk aversion, narrow success definitions). Different dimensions = distinct arguments.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight-sophistication">Ultimately, Singapore's approach to preparing young people for modern uncertainties succeeds admirably at what it prioritizes - technical excellence and institutional support - while failing at what it neglects: psychological resilience and cultural adaptability.</span> <span class="highlight-relevance">We have built a system optimized for navigating predictable pathways to success, not for thriving amid genuine unpredictability.</span> <span class="highlight-evaluation">Our young people enter an uncertain world with exceptional analytical tools and material resources, but without the emotional resilience to weather setbacks, the tolerance for ambiguity to explore undefined paths, or the cultural permission to fail and learn.</span> <span class="highlight-sophistication">This represents only moderate effectiveness because the dimensions we neglect - psychological and cultural foundations - ultimately determine whether technical skills can be deployed successfully under stress, whether institutional support translates into genuine adaptation, and whether our youth can find not merely employment but meaning and wellbeing in an unpredictable future.</span> <span class="highlight-link">To truly prepare young Singaporeans for modern uncertainties, we must recognize that effectiveness requires not merely better programs or skills training, but fundamental shifts in how our culture values failure, how our education system balances achievement with resilience, and how we define success itself.</span>

                <strong>CONCLUSION ANALYSIS: Sophisticated Synthesis</strong>
                <p><strong>How this synthesizes rather than repeats:</strong> Instead of "some good, some bad, more bad," the conclusion introduces a framework: "succeeds at what it prioritizes...fails at what it neglects." This is a more sophisticated understanding than the question's surface-level framing.</p>
                <p><strong>New insight:</strong> "the dimensions we neglect...ultimately determine whether technical skills can be deployed successfully" - this is a new point not made earlier, showing that psychological/cultural foundations aren't just separate issues but prerequisites for using technical preparation effectively.</p>
                <p><strong>Forward-looking:</strong> Final sentence points toward what would make preparation truly effective, showing you've thought beyond the question to solutions.</p>
                <p><strong>Nuanced judgment:</strong> "moderate effectiveness" is more sophisticated than "effective" or "ineffective" - acknowledges complexity while making clear assessment.</p>

        <div class="critical-note">
            <strong>ADDRESSING YOUR MAIN WEAKNESS: Question-First Thinking for Singapore Context</strong>
            <p>For "your society" questions, it's tempting to immediately list what you know about Singapore. This essay avoided that trap:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Started with the question's requirements:</strong> "What does it mean to be prepared for uncertainty?" → Defined multiple dimensions (technical, psychological, cultural) BEFORE thinking about Singapore specifically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Used AAME framework strategically:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Education-focused trait</strong> → Generated P1 about strong academic foundation</li>
                        <li><strong>Pragmatic trait</strong> → Generated P2 about institutional programs like SkillsFuture</li>
                        <li><strong>Meritocratic trait</strong> → Generated P4 about how achievement focus creates fear of failure</li>
                        <li><strong>Asian Conservative trait</strong> → Informed P4 about risk-averse kiasu culture</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each Singapore trait was selected BECAUSE it specifically relates to uncertainty preparation, not just mentioned because "I know about Singapore."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Examples chosen for relevance:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SkillsFuture mentioned BECAUSE it specifically addresses career transitions and reskilling</li>
                        <li>Mental health data mentioned BECAUSE it indicates psychological unpreparedness for stress/uncertainty</li>
                        <li>Kiasu culture mentioned BECAUSE risk aversion undermines adaptability needed for uncertainty</li>
                    </ul>
                    Every Singapore-specific point was selected to prove a specific argument about preparation effectiveness.

            <strong>GENERATING ORIGINAL POINTS: The Paradox Technique</strong>
            <p>One powerful way to create sophisticated arguments is identifying PARADOXES - how strengths create weaknesses:</p>
            <p><strong>Paragraph 4's paradox:</strong> "Singapore's meritocratic emphasis on achievement has made failure terrifying rather than instructive, when modern uncertainty requires precisely the opposite."</p>
            <p><strong>Why this is powerful:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's ORIGINAL - not a recycled point about "Singapore has strict education"</li>
                <li>It's SPECIFIC to this question - connects meritocracy directly to uncertainty preparation</li>
                <li>It shows SOPHISTICATED thinking - understanding how the same factor (meritocracy) can be both strength and weakness depending on context</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to find paradoxes:</strong> Take any Singapore trait and ask "How might this strength create a corresponding weakness?" This generates fresh arguments specific to each question.</p>

                <li><strong>For each relevant trait, ask: "How does this trait relate to the question's specific focus?"</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For uncertainty preparation: Meritocratic → fear of failure → risk aversion → undermines adaptability</li>
                        <li>For uncertainty preparation: Paternalistic → strong support programs → provides resources BUT potentially creates dependency</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Build each paragraph around ONE trait's relationship to the question</strong> (prevents repetition)</li>
                <li><strong>Find the PARADOX in each trait:</strong> How might this strength create a weakness in this specific context?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This ensures your Singapore examples are RELEVANT to the specific question, not just generic facts about Singapore.</p>

            <strong>ADDITIONAL EXERCISE: The Effectiveness Question Framework</strong>
            <p>For any "How effectively..." question, complete this analysis BEFORE writing:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Define success:</strong> What would "effective" achievement of the goal look like? What are the success criteria?</li>
                <li><strong>Identify dimensions:</strong> What are the different aspects that need to be effective? (For uncertainty prep: technical, psychological, cultural, institutional)</li>
                <li><strong>Assess each dimension:</strong> Rate Singapore's effectiveness in each (high/medium/low) and identify evidence</li>
                <li><strong>Weight the dimensions:</strong> Which dimensions are more fundamental/important? (Helps you reach overall judgment)</li>
                <li><strong>Make nuanced judgment:</strong> Not "effective" or "ineffective" but "effective in X, ineffective in Y, overall moderate because Y is more fundamental"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This structured approach ensures you answer effectiveness questions with sophistication rather than simple yes/no.</p>
